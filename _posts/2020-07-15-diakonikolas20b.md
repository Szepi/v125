title: Approximation Schemes for ReLU Regression
abstract: " We consider the fundamental problem of ReLU regression, where the goal
  is to output the best fitting ReLU with respect to square loss given access to draws
  from some unknown distribution.  We give the first efficient, constant-factor approximation
  algorithm for this problem assuming the underlying distribution satisfies some weak
  concentration and anti-concentration conditions (and includes, for example, all
  log-concave distributions).  This solves the main open problem of Goel et al., who
  proved hardness results for any exact algorithm for ReLU regression (up to an additive
  $\\epsilon$). Using more sophisticated techniques, we can improve our results and
  obtain a polynomial-time approximation scheme for any subgaussian distribution.
  \ Given the aforementioned hardness results, these guarantees can not be substantially
  improved. Our main insight is a new characterization of {\\em surrogate losses}
  for nonconvex activations.  While prior work had established the existence of convex
  surrogates for monotone activations, we show that properties of the underlying distribution
  actually induce strong convexity for the loss, allowing us to relate the global
  minimum to the activationâ€™s {\\em Chow parameters}. "
