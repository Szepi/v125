title: Free Energy Wells and Overlap Gap Property in Sparse PCA
abstract: " We study a variant of the sparse PCA (principal component analysis) problem
  in the “hard” regime, where the inference task is possible yet no polynomial-time
  algorithm is known to exist. Prior work, based on the low-degree likelihood ratio,
  has conjectured a precise expression for the best possible (sub-exponential) runtime
  throughout the hard regime. Following instead a statistical physics inspired point
  of view, we show bounds on the depth of free energy wells for various Gibbs measures
  naturally associated to the problem. These free energy wells imply hitting time
  lower bounds that corroborate the low-degree conjecture: we show that a class of
  natural MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) methods (with worst-case initialization)
  cannot solve sparse PCA with less than the conjectured runtime. These lower bounds
  apply to a wide range of values for two tuning parameters: temperature and sparsity
  misparametrization. Finally, we prove that the Overlap Gap Property (OGP), a structural
  property that implies failure of certain local search algorithms, holds in a significant
  part of the hard regime."
