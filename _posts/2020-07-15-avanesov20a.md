title: Data-driven confidence bands for distributed nonparametric regression
abstract: " Gaussian Process Regression and Kernel Ridge Regression are popular nonparametric
  regression approaches. Unfortunately, they suffer from high computational complexity
  rendering them inapplicable to the modern massive datasets. To that end a number
  of approximations have been suggested, some of them allowing for a distributed implementation.
  One of them is the divide and conquer approach, splitting the data into a number
  of partitions, obtaining the local estimates and finally averaging them. In this
  paper we suggest a novel computationally efficient fully data-driven algorithm,
  quantifying uncertainty of this method, yielding frequentist $L_2$-confidence bands.
  We rigorously demonstrate validity of the algorithm. Another contribution of the
  paper is a minimax-optimal high-probability bound for the averaged estimator, complementing
  and generalizing the known risk bounds."
