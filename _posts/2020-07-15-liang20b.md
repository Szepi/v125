title: Learning Entangled Single-Sample Gaussians in the Subset-of-Signals Model
abstract: " In the setting of entangled single-sample distributions, the goal is to
  estimate some common parameter shared by a family of $n$ distributions, given one
  single sample from each distribution. This paper studies mean estimation for entangled
  single-sample Gaussians that have a common mean but different unknown variances.
  We propose the subset-of-signals model where an unknown subset of $m$ variances
  are bounded by 1 while there are no assumptions on the other variances. In this
  model, we analyze a simple and natural method based on iteratively averaging the
  truncated samples, and show that the method achieves error $O \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{n\\ln
  n}}{m}\\right)$ with high probability when $m=\\Omega(\\sqrt{n\\ln n})$, slightly
  improving existing bounds for this range of $m$. We further prove lower bounds,
  showing that the error is $\\Omega\\left(\\left(\\frac{n}{m^4}\\right)^{1/2}\\right)$
  when $m$ is between $\\Omega(\\ln n)$ and $O(n^{1/4})$, and the error is $\\Omega\\left(\\left(\\frac{n}{m^4}\\right)^{1/6}\\right)$
  when $m$ is between $\\Omega(n^{1/4})$ and $O(n^{1 - \\epsilon})$ for an arbitrarily
  small $\\epsilon>0$, improving existing lower bounds and extending to a wider range
  of $m$."
