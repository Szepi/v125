title: 'Non-Stochastic Multi-Player Multi-Armed Bandits: Optimal Rate With Collision
  Information, Sublinear Without'
abstract: " We consider the non-stochastic version of the (cooperative) multi-player
  multi-armed bandit problem. The model assumes no communication and no shared randomness
  at all between the players, and furthermore when two (or more) players select the
  same action this results in a maximal loss. We prove the first $\\sqrt{T}$-type
  regret guarantee for this problem, assuming only two players, and under the feedback
  model where collisions are announced to the colliding players. We also prove the
  first sublinear regret guarantee for the feedback model where collision information
  is not available, namely $T^{1-\\frac{1}{2m}}$ where $m$ is the number of players."
