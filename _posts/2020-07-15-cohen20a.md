title: Pessimism About Unknown Unknowns Inspires Conservatism
abstract: " If we could define the set of all bad outcomes, we could hard-code an
  agent which avoids them; however, in sufficiently complex environments, this is
  infeasible. We do not know of any general-purpose approaches in the literature to
  avoiding novel failure modes. Motivated by this, we define an idealized Bayesian
  reinforcement learner which follows a policy that maximizes the worst-case expected
  reward over a set of world-models. We call this agent pessimistic, since it optimizes
  assuming the worst case. A scalar parameter tunes the agent’s pessimism by changing
  the size of the set of world-models taken into account. Our first main contribution
  is: given an assumption about the agent’s model class, a sufficiently pessimistic
  agent does not cause “unprecedented events” with probability $1-\\delta$, whether
  or not designers know how to precisely specify those precedents they are concerned
  with. Since pessimism discourages exploration, at each timestep, the agent may defer
  to a mentor, who may be a human or some known-safe policy we would like to improve.
  Our other main contribution is that the agent’s policy’s value approaches at least
  that of the mentor, while the probability of deferring to the mentor goes to 0.
  In high-stakes environments, we might like advanced artificial agents to pursue
  goals cautiously, which is a non-trivial problem even if the agent were allowed
  arbitrary computing power; we present a formal solution."
