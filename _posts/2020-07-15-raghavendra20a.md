title: List Decodable Subspace Recovery
abstract: ' Learning from data in the presence of outliers is a fundamental problem
  in statistics.  In this work, we study robust statistics in the presence of overwhelming
  outliers for the fundamental problem of subspace recovery.  Given a dataset where
  an $\alpha$ fraction (less than half) of the data is distributed uniformly in an
  unknown $k$ dimensional subspace in $d$ dimensions, and with no additional assumptions
  on the remaining data, the goal is to recover a succinct list of $O(\frac{1}{\alpha})$
  subspaces one of which is nontrivially correlated with the planted subspace.  We
  provide the first polynomial time algorithm for the ’list decodable subspace recovery’
  problem, and subsume it under a more general framework of list decoding over distributions
  that are "certifiably resilient" capturing state of the art results for list decodable
  mean estimation and regression.'
