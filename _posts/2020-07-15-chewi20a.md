title: Gradient descent algorithms for Bures-Wasserstein barycenters
abstract: " We study first order methods to compute the barycenter of a probability
  distribution $P$ over the space of probability measures with finite second moment.
  We develop a framework to derive global rates of convergence for both gradient descent
  and stochastic gradient descent despite the fact that the barycenter functional
  is not geodesically convex. Our analysis overcomes this technical hurdle by employing
  a Polyak-≈Å{}ojasiewicz (PL) inequality and relies on tools from optimal transport
  and metric geometry. In turn, we establish a PL inequality when $P$ is supported
  on the Bures-Wasserstein manifold of Gaussian probability measures. It leads to
  the first global rates of convergence for first order methods in this context. "
