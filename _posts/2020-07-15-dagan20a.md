title: PAC learning with stable and private predictions
abstract: " We study binary classification algorithms for which the prediction on
  any point is not too sensitive to individual examples in the dataset. Specifically,
  we consider the notions of uniform stability (Bousquet and Elisseeff, 2001) and
  prediction privacy (Dwork and Feldman, 2018). Previous work on these notions shows
  how they can be achieved in the standard PAC model via simple aggregation of models
  trained on disjoint subsets of data. Unfortunately, this approach leads to a significant
  overhead in terms of sample complexity. Here we demonstrate several general approaches
  to stable and private prediction that either eliminate or significantly reduce the
  overhead. Specifically, we demonstrate that for any class $C$ of VC dimension $d$
  there exists a $\\gamma$-uniformly stable algorithm for learning $C$ with excess
  error $\\alpha$ using $\\tilde O(d/(\\alpha\\gamma) + d/\\alpha^2)$ samples. We
  also show that this bound is nearly tight. For $\\eps$-differentially private prediction
  we give two new algorithms: one using $\\tilde O(d/(\\alpha^2\\eps))$ samples and
  another one using $\\tilde O(d^2/(\\alpha\\eps) + d/\\alpha^2)$ samples. The best
  previously  known  bounds for these problems are $O(d/(\\alpha^2\\gamma))$ and $O(d/(\\alpha^3\\eps))$,
  respectively."
