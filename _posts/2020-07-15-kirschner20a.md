title: Information Directed Sampling for Linear Partial Monitoring
abstract: " Partial monitoring is a rich framework for sequential decision making
  under uncertainty that generalizes many well known bandit models, including linear,
  combinatorial  and dueling bandits. We introduce {\\em information directed sampling}
  (IDS) for stochastic partial monitoring with a linear reward and observation structure.
  IDS achieves adaptive worst-case regret rates that depend on precise observability
  conditions of the game. Moreover, we prove lower bounds that classify the minimax
  regret of all finite games into four possible regimes. IDS achieves the optimal
  rate in all cases  up to logarithmic factors, without tuning any hyper-parameters.
  We further extend our results to the contextual and the kernelized setting, which
  significantly increases the range of possible applications."
