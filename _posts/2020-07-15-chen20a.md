title: Learning Polynomials in Few Relevant Dimensions
abstract: " Polynomial regression is a basic primitive in learning and statistics.
  In its most basic form the goal is to fit a degree $d$ polynomial  to a response
  variable $y$ in terms of an $n$-dimensional input vector $x$. This is extremely
  well-studied with many applications and has sample and runtime complexity $\\Theta(n^d)$.
  Can one achieve better runtime if the intrinsic dimension of the data is much smaller
  than the ambient dimension $n$? Concretely, we are given samples $(x,y)$ where $y$
  is a degree at most $d$ polynomial in an unknown $r$-dimensional projection (the
  relevant dimensions) of $x$. This can be seen both as a generalization of phase
  retrieval and as a special case of learning multi-index models where the link function
  is an unknown low-degree polynomial. Note that without distributional assumptions,
  this is at least as hard as junta learning. In this work we consider the important
  case where the covariates are Gaussian. We give an algorithm that learns the polynomial
  within accuracy $\\epsilon$ with sample complexity that is roughly $N = O_{r,d}(n
  \\log^2(1/\\epsilon) (\\log n)^d)$ and runtime $O_{r,d}(N n^2)$. Prior to our work,
  no such results were known even for the case of $r=1$. We introduce a new \\emph{filtered
  PCA} approach to get a warm start for the true subspace and use \\emph{geodesic
  SGD} to boost to arbitrary accuracy; our techniques may be of independent interest,
  especially for problems dealing with subspace recovery or analyzing SGD on manifolds."
