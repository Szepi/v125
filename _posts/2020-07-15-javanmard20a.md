title: Precise Tradeoffs in Adversarial Training for Linear Regression
abstract: " Despite breakthrough performance, modern learning models are known to
  be highly vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations in their inputs. While a
  wide variety of recent \\emph{adversarial training} methods have been effective
  at improving robustness to perturbed inputs (robust accuracy), often this benefit
  is accompanied by a decrease in accuracy on benign inputs (standard accuracy), leading
  to a tradeoff between often competing objectives. Complicating matters further,
  recent empirical evidence suggest that a variety of other factors (size and quality
  of training data, model size, etc.) affect this tradeoff in somewhat surprising
  ways. In this paper we provide a precise and comprehensive understanding of the
  role of adversarial training in the context of linear regression with Gaussian features.
  In particular, we characterize the fundamental tradeoff between the accuracies achievable
  by any algorithm regardless of computational power or size of the training data.
  Furthermore, we precisely characterize the standard/robust accuracy and the corresponding
  tradeoff achieved by a contemporary mini-max adversarial training approach in a
  high-dimensional regime where the number of data points and the parameters of the
  model grow in proportion to each other. Our theory for adversarial training algorithms
  also facilitates the rigorous study of how a variety of factors (size and quality
  of training data, model overparametrization etc.) affect the tradeoff between these
  two competing accuracies. "
