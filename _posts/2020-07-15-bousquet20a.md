title: Proper Learning, Helly Number, and an Optimal SVM Bound
abstract: " The classical PAC sample complexity bounds are stated for any Empirical
  Risk Minimizer (ERM) and contain an extra logarithmic factor $\\log(1/\\epsilon)$
  which is known to be necessary for ERM in general. It has been recently shown by
  Hanneke (2016) that the optimal sample complexity of PAC learning for any VC class
  C does not include this log factor and is achieved by a particular improper learning
  algorithm, which outputs a specific majority-vote of hypotheses in C. This leaves
  the question of when this bound can be achieved by proper learning algorithms, which
  are restricted to always output a hypothesis from C. In this paper we aim to characterize
  the classes for which the optimal sample complexity can be achieved by a proper
  learning algorithm. We identify that these classes can be characterized by the dual
  Helly number, which is a combinatorial parameter that arises in discrete geometry
  and abstract convexity. In particular, under general conditions on C, we show that
  the dual Helly number is bounded if and only if there is a proper learner that obtains
  the optimal dependence on $\\epsilon$. As further implications of our techniques
  we resolve a long-standing open problem posed by Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1974)
  on the performance of the Support Vector Machine by proving that the sample complexity
  of SVM in the realizable case is $\\Theta((n/\\epsilon)+(1/\\epsilon)\\log(1/\\delta))$,
  where $n$ is the dimension. This gives the first optimal PAC bound for Halfspaces
  achieved by a proper learning algorithm, and moreover is computationally efficient."
