title: Pan-Private Uniformity Testing
abstract: " A centrally differentially private algorithm maps raw data to differentially
  private outputs. In contrast, a locally differentially private algorithm may only
  access data through public interaction with data holders, and this interaction must
  be a differentially private function of the data. We study the intermediate model
  of \\emph{pan-privacy}. Unlike a locally private algorithm, a pan-private algorithm
  receives data in the clear. Unlike a centrally private algorithm, the algorithm
  receives data one element at a time and must maintain a differentially private internal
  state while processing this stream. First, we show that pan-privacy against multiple
  intrusions on the internal state is equivalent to sequentially interactive local
  privacy. Next, we contextualize pan-privacy against a single intrusion by analyzing
  the sample complexity of uniformity testing over domain $[k]$. Focusing on the dependence
  on $k$, centrally private uniformity testing has sample complexity $\\Theta(\\sqrt{k})$,
  while noninteractive locally private uniformity testing has sample complexity $\\Theta(k)$.
  We show that the sample complexity of pan-private uniformity testing is $\\Theta(k^{2/3})$.
  By a new $\\Omega(k)$ lower bound for the sequentially interactive setting, we also
  separate pan-private from sequentially interactive locally private and multi-intrusion
  pan-private uniformity testing."
