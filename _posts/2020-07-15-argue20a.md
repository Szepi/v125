title: Dimension-Free Bounds for Chasing Convex Functions
abstract: " We consider the problem of chasing convex functions, where functions arrive
  over time. The player takes actions after seeing the function, and the goal is to
  achieve a small function cost for these actions, as well as a small cost for moving
  between actions. While the general problem requires a polynomial dependence on the
  dimension, we show how to get dimension-independent bounds for well-behaved functions.
  In particular, we consider the case where the convex functions are $\\kappa$-well-conditioned,
  and give an algorithm that achieves an $O(\\sqrt \\kappa)$-competitiveness. Moreover,
  when the functions are supported on $k$-dimensional affine subspaces—e.g., when
  the function are the indicators of some affine subspaces—we get $O(\\min(k, \\sqrt{k
  \\log T}))$-competitive algorithms for request sequences of length $T$. We also
  show some lower bounds, that well-conditioned functions require $\\Omega(\\kappa^{1/3})$-competitiveness,
  and $k$-dimensional functions require $\\Omega(\\sqrt{k})$-competitiveness."
