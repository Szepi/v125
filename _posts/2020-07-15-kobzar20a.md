title: New Potential-Based Bounds for Prediction with Expert Advice
abstract: " This work addresses the classic machine learning problem of online prediction
  with expert advice. We consider the finite-horizon version of this zero-sum, two-person
  game. Using verification  arguments  from optimal control theory, we view the task
  of finding  better lower and upper bounds on the value of the game (regret) as the
  problem of finding better sub- and supersolutions of certain partial differential
  equations (PDEs). These sub- and supersolutions serve as the potentials for player
  and adversary strategies, which lead to the corresponding bounds. To get explicit
  bounds, we use closed-form solutions of specific PDEs. Our bounds hold for any given
  number of experts and horizon; in certain regimes (which we identify) they improve
  upon the previous state of the art. For two and three experts, our bounds provide
  the optimal leading order term. "
