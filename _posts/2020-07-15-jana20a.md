title: Extrapolating the profile of a finite population
abstract: " We study a prototypical problem in empirical Bayes. Namely, consider a
  population consisting of $k$ individuals each belonging to one of $k$ types (some
  types can be empty). Without any structural restrictions, it is impossible to learn
  the composition of the full population having observed only a small (random) subsample
  of size $m = o(k)$. Nevertheless, we show that in the sublinear regime of $m =\\omega(k/\\log
  k)$, it is possible to consistently estimate in total variation the \\emph{profile}
  of the population, defined as the empirical distribution of the sizes of each type,
  which determines many symmetric properties of the population. We also prove that
  in the linear regime of $m=c k$ for any constant $c$ the optimal rate is $\\Theta(1/\\log
  k)$. Our estimator is based on Wolfowitzâ€™s minimum distance method, which entails
  solving a linear program (LP) of size $k$. We show that there is a single infinite-dimensional
  LP whose value simultaneously characterizes the risk of the minimum distance estimator
  and certifies its minimax optimality. The sharp convergence rate is obtained by
  evaluating this LP using complex-analytic techniques. "
