title: Asymptotic Errors for High-Dimensional Convex Penalized Linear Regression beyond
  Gaussian Matrices
abstract: " We consider the problem of learning a coefficient vector $\\bf x_0 \\in
  \\mathbb R^N$ from noisy linear observations $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{F}{\\mathbf{x}_{0}}+\\mathbf{w}
  \\in \\mathbb R^M$ in high dimensional limit $M,N \\to \\infty$ with $\\alpha \\equiv
  M/N$ fixed. We provide a rigorous derivation of an explicit formula —first conjectured
  using heuristics method from statistical physics— for the asymptotic mean squared
  error obtained by penalized convex estimators such as the LASSO or the elastic net,
  for a sequence of very generic random matrix $\\mathbf{F}$ corresponding to rotationally
  invariant data matrices of arbitrary spectrum.  The proof is based on a convergence
  analysis of an oracle version of vector approximate message-passing (oracle-VAMP)
  and on the properties of its state evolution equations. Our method leverages on
  and highlights the link between vector approximate message-passing, Douglas-Rachford
  splitting and proximal descent algorithms, extending previous results obtained with
  i.i.d. matrices for a large class of problems. We illustrate our results on some
  concrete examples and show that even though they are asymptotic, our predictions
  agree remarkably well with numerics even for very moderate sizes."
