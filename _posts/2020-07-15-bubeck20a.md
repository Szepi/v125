title: 'Coordination without communication: optimal regret in two players multi-armed
  bandits'
abstract: " We consider two agents playing simultaneously the same stochastic three-armed
  bandit problem. The two agents are cooperating but they cannot communicate. Under
  the assumption that shared randomness is available, we propose a strategy with no
  collisions at all between the players (with very high probability), and with near-optimal
  regret $O(\\sqrt{T \\log(T)})$. We also argue that the extra logarithmic term $\\sqrt{\\log(T)}$
  should be necessary by proving a lower bound for a full information variant of the
  problem."
