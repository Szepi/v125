title: Fast Rates for Online Prediction with Abstention
abstract: " In the setting of sequential prediction of individual $(0, 1)$-sequences
  with expert advice, we show that by allowing the learner to abstain from the prediction
  by paying a cost marginally smaller than $0.5$ (say, $0.49$), it is possible to
  achieve expected regret bounds that are independent of the time horizon T. We exactly
  characterize the dependence on the abstention cost $c$ and the number of experts
  N by providing matching upper and lower bounds of order $\\frac{log N} {1âˆ’2c}$,
  which is to be contrasted with the best possible rate of $\\sqrt{T\\log N}$ that
  is available without the option to abstain. We also discuss various extensions of
  our model, including a setting where the sequence of abstention costs can change
  arbitrarily over time, where we show regret bounds interpolating between the slow
  and the fast rates mentioned above, under some natural assumptions on the sequence
  of abstention costs"
