title: 'Open Problem: Fast and Optimal Online Portfolio Selection'
abstract: 'Online portfolio selection has received much attention in the COLT community
  since its introduction by Cover, but all state-of-the-art methods fall short in
  at least one of the following ways: they are either i) computationally infeasible;
  or ii) they do not guarantee optimal regret; or iii) they assume the gradients are
  bounded, which is unnecessary and cannot be guaranteed. We are interested in a natural
  follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) approach based on the log barrier regularizer,
  which is computationally feasible. The open problem we put before the community
  is to formally prove whether this approach achieves the optimal regret. Resolving
  this question will likely lead to new techniques to analyse FTRL algorithms. There
  are also interesting technical connections to self-concordance, which has previously
  been used in the context of bandit convex optimization.'
