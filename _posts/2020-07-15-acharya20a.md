title: Domain Compression and its Application to Randomness-Optimal Distributed Goodness-of-Fit
abstract: " We study goodness-of-fit of discrete distributions in the distributed
  setting, where samples are divided between multiple users who can only release a
  limited amount of information about their samples due to various information constraints.
  Recently, a subset of the authors showed that having access to a common random seed
  (i.e., shared randomness) leads to a significant reduction in the sample complexity
  of this problem. In this work, we provide a complete understanding of the interplay
  between the amount of shared randomness available, the stringency of information
  constraints, and the sample complexity of the testing problem by characterizing
  a tight trade-off between these three parameters. We provide a general distributed
  goodness-of-fit protocol that as a function of the amount of shared randomness interpolates
  smoothly between the private- and public-coin sample complexities. We complement
  our upper bound with a general framework to prove lower bounds on the sample complexity
  of this testing problems under limited shared randomness. Finally, we instantiate
  our bounds for the two archetypal information constraints of communication and local
  privacy, and show that our sample complexity bounds are optimal as a function of
  all the parameters of the problem, including the amount of shared randomness. A
  key component of our upper bounds is a new primitive of \\textit{domain compression},
  a tool that allows us to map distributions to a much smaller domain size while preserving
  their pairwise distances, using a limited amount of randomness. "
