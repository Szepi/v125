title: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with a Generative Model is Minimax Optimal
abstract: " This work considers the sample and computational complexity of obtaining
  an $\\epsilon$-optimal policy in a discounted Markov Decision Process (MDP), given
  only access to a generative model. In this model, the learner accesses the underlying
  transition model via a sampling oracle that provides a sample of the next state,
  when given any state-action pair as input. We are interested in a basic and unresolved
  question in model based planning: is this naïve “plug-in” approach — where we build
  the maximum likelihood estimate of the transition model in the MDP from observations
  and then find an optimal policy in this empirical MDP — non-asymptotically, minimax
  optimal? Our main result answers this question positively. With regards to computation,
  our result provides a simpler approach towards minimax optimal planning: in comparison
  to prior model-free results,  we show that using \\emph{any} high accuracy, black-box
  planning oracle in the empirical model suffices to obtain the minimax error rate.
  The key proof technique uses a leave-one-out analysis, in a novel “absorbing MDP”
  construction, to decouple the statistical dependency issues that arise in the analysis
  of model-based planning; this construction may be helpful more generally."
