title: Balancing Gaussian vectors in high dimension
abstract: "  Motivated by problems in controlled experiments, we study the discrepancy
  of random matrices with continuous entries where the number of columns $n$ is much
  larger than the number of rows $m$. Our first result shows that if $\\omega(1) =
  m = o(n)$,  a matrix with i.i.d. standard Gaussian entries has discrepancy $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n}
  \\, 2^{-n/m})$ with high probability. This provides sharp guarantees for Gaussian
  discrepancy in a regime that had not been considered before in the existing literature.
  Our results also apply to a more general family of random matrices with continuous
  i.i.d. entries, assuming that $m = O(n/\\log{n})$. The proof is non-constructive
  and is an application of the second moment method. Our second result is algorithmic
  and applies to random matrices whose entries are i.i.d. and have a Lipschitz density.
  We present a randomized polynomial-time algorithm that achieves discrepancy $e^{-\\Omega(\\log^2(n)/m)}$
  with high probability, provided that $m = O(\\sqrt{\\log{n}})$. In the one-dimensional
  case, this matches the best known algorithmic guarantees due to Karmarkarâ€“Karp.
  For higher dimensions $2 \\leq m = O(\\sqrt{\\log{n}})$, this establishes the first
  efficient algorithm achieving discrepancy smaller than $O( \\sqrt{m} )$.  "
