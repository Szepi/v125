title: Halpern Iteration for Near-Optimal and Parameter-Free Monotone Inclusion and
  Strong Solutions to Variational Inequalities
abstract: " We leverage the connections between nonexpansive maps, monotone Lipschitz
  operators, and proximal mappings to obtain near-optimal (i.e., optimal up to poly-log
  factors in terms of iteration complexity) and parameter-free methods for solving
  monotone inclusion problems. These results immediately translate into near-optimal
  guarantees for approximating strong solutions to variational inequality problems,
  approximating convex-concave min-max optimization problems, and minimizing the norm
  of the gradient in min-max optimization problems. Our analysis is based on a novel
  and simple potential-based proof of convergence of Halpern iteration, a classical
  iteration for finding fixed points of nonexpansive maps.  Additionally, we provide
  a series of algorithmic reductions that highlight connections between different
  problem classes and lead to lower bounds that certify near-optimality of the studied
  methods."
