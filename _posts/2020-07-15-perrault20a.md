title: Covariance-adapting algorithm for semi-bandits with application to sparse outcomes
abstract: " We investigate \\emph{stochastic combinatorial semi-bandits}, where the
  entire joint distribution of outcomes impacts the complexity of the problem instance
  (unlike in the standard bandits).  Typical distributions considered depend on specific
  parameter values, whose prior knowledge is required in theory but quite difficult
  to estimate in practice; an example is the commonly assumed \\emph{sub-Gaussian}
  family. We alleviate this issue by instead considering a new general family  of
  \\emph{sub-exponential} distributions, which contains bounded and Gaussian  ones.
  We prove a new lower bound on the regret on this family, that is parameterized by
  the \\emph{unknown} covariance matrix, a tighter quantity than the sub-Gaussian
  matrix. We then construct an algorithm that uses covariance estimates, and provide
  a tight asymptotic analysis of the regret. Finally, we apply and extend our results
  to the family of sparse outcomes, which has applications in many recommender systems. "
