title: Reducibility and Statistical-Computational Gaps from Secret Leakage
abstract: " Inference problems with conjectured statistical-computational gaps are
  ubiquitous throughout modern statistics, computer science, statistical physics and
  discrete probability. While there has been success evidencing these gaps from the
  failure of restricted classes of algorithms, progress towards a more traditional
  reduction-based approach to computational complexity in statistical inference has
  been limited. These average-case problems are each tied to a different natural distribution,
  high-dimensional structure and conjecturally hard parameter regime, leaving reductions
  among them technically challenging. Despite a flurry of recent success in developing
  such techniques, existing reductions have largely been limited to inference problems
  with similar structure – primarily mapping among problems representable as a sparse
  submatrix signal plus a noise matrix, which is similar to the common starting hardness
  assumption of planted clique ($\\textsc{pc}$). The insight in this work is that
  a slight generalization of the planted clique conjecture – secret leakage planted
  clique ($\\textsc{pc}_\\rho$), wherein a small amount of information about the hidden
  clique is revealed – gives rise to a variety of new average-case reduction techniques,
  yielding a web of reductions relating statistical problems with very different structure.
  Based on generalizations of the planted clique conjecture to specific forms of $\\textsc{pc}_\\rho$,
  we deduce tight statistical-computational tradeoffs for a diverse range of problems
  including robust sparse mean estimation, mixtures of sparse linear regressions,
  robust sparse linear regression, tensor PCA, variants of dense $k$-block stochastic
  block models, negatively correlated sparse PCA, semirandom planted dense subgraph,
  detection in hidden partition models and a universality principle for learning sparse
  mixtures. This gives the first reduction-based evidence for a number of conjectured
  statistical-computational gaps. We introduce a number of new average-case reduction
  techniques that also reveal novel connections to combinatorial designs based on
  the incidence geometry of $\\mathbb{F}_r^t$ and to random matrix theory. In particular,
  we show a convergence result between Wishart and inverse Wishart matrices that may
  be of independent interest. The specific hardness conjectures for $\\textsc{pc}_\\rho$
  implying our statistical-computational gaps all are in correspondence with natural
  graph problems such as $k$-partite, bipartite and hypergraph variants of $\\textsc{pc}$.
  Hardness in a $k$-partite hypergraph variant of $\\textsc{pc}$ is the strongest
  of these conjectures and sufficient to establish all of our computational lower
  bounds. We also give evidence for our $\\textsc{pc}_\\rho$ hardness conjectures
  from the failure of low-degree polynomials and statistical query algorithms. Our
  work raises a number of open problems and suggests that previous technical obstacles
  to average-case reductions may have arisen because planted clique is not the right
  starting point. An expanded set of hardness assumptions, such as $\\textsc{pc}_\\rho$,
  may be a key first step towards a more complete theory of reductions among statistical
  problems."
