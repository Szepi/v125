title: 'Hierarchical Clustering: A 0.585 Revenue Approximation'
abstract: " Hierarchical Clustering trees have been widely accepted as a useful form
  of clustering data, resulting in a prevalence of adopting fields including phylogenetics,
  image analysis, bioinformatics and more.  Recently, Dasgupta (STOC 16’) initiated
  the analysis of these types of algorithms through the lenses of approximation. Later,
  the dual problem was considered by Moseley and Wang (NIPS 17’) dubbing it the Revenue
  goal function. In this problem, given a nonnegative weight $w_{ij}$ for each pair
  $i,j \\in [n]=\\{1,2, \\ldots ,n\\}$, the objective is to find a tree $T$ whose
  set of leaves is $[n]$ that maximizes the function $\\sum_{i<j \\in [n]} w_{ij}
  (n -|T_{ij}|)$, where $|T_{ij}|$  is the number of leaves in the subtree rooted
  at the least common ancestor of $i$ and $j$. In our work we consider the revenue
  goal function and prove the following results. First, we prove the existence of
  a bisection (i.e., a tree of depth $2$ in which the root has two children, each
  being a parent of $n/2$ leaves) which approximates the general optimal tree solution
  up to a factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ (which is tight). Second, we apply this result
  in order to prove a $\\frac{2}{3}p$ approximation for the general revenue problem,
  where $p$ is defined as the approximation ratio of the \\textsc{Max-Uncut Bisection}
  problem. Since $p$ is known to be at least $0.8776$ (Austrin et al., 2016) (Wu et
  al., 2015), we get a $0.585$ approximation algorithm for the revenue problem. This
  improves a sequence of earlier results which culminated in an $0.4246$-approximation
  guarantee (Ahmadian et al., 2019)."
