title: Kernel and Rich Regimes in Overparametrized Models
abstract: " A recent line of work studies overparametrized neural networks in the
  “kernel regime,” i.e. when  during training the network behaves as a kernelized
  linear predictor, and thus, training with gradient descent has the effect of finding
  the corresponding minimum RKHS norm solution.  This stands in contrast to other
  studies which demonstrate how gradient descent on overparametrized  networks can
  induce rich implicit biases that are not RKHS norms.  Building on an observation
  by \\citet{chizat2018note}, we show how the \\textbf{\\textit{scale of the initialization}}
  controls the transition between the “kernel” (aka lazy) and “rich” (aka active)
  regimes and affects generalization properties in multilayer homogeneous models.
  We provide a complete and detailed analysis for a family of simple depth-$D$ linear
  networks that exhibit an interesting and meaningful transition between the kernel
  and rich regimes, and highlight an interesting role for the \\emph{width}  of the
  models. We further demonstrate this transition empirically for matrix factorization
  and multilayer non-linear networks."
