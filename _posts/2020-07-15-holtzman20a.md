title: A Greedy Anytime Algorithm for Sparse PCA
abstract: " The taxing computational effort that is involved in solving some high-dimensional
  statistical problems, in particular problems involving non-convex optimization,
  has popularized the development and analysis of algorithms that run efficiently
  (polynomial-time) but with no general guarantee on statistical consistency. In light
  of the ever-increasing compute power and decreasing costs, a more useful characterization
  of algorithms is by their ability to  calibrate the invested computational effort
  with various characteristics of the input at hand and with the available computational
  resources. We propose a new greedy algorithm for the $\\ell_0$-sparse PCA problem
  which supports the calibration principle. We provide both a rigorous analysis of
  our algorithm in the spiked covariance model, as well as simulation results and
  comparison with other existing methods. Our findings show that our algorithm recovers
  the spike in SNR regimes where all polynomial-time algorithms fail while running
  in a reasonable parallel-time on a cluster."
