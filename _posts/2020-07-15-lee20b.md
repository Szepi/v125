title: Logsmooth Gradient Concentration and Tighter Runtimes for Metropolized Hamiltonian
  Monte Carlo
abstract: " We show that the gradient norm $\\norm{\\nabla f(x)}$ for $x \\sim \\exp(-f(x))$,
  where $f$ is strongly convex and smooth, concentrates tightly around its mean. This
  removes a barrier in the prior state-of-the-art analysis for the well-studied Metropolized
  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm for sampling from a strongly logconcave
  distribution. We correspondingly demonstrate  that Metropolized HMC mixes in $\\tilde{O}(\\kappa
  d)$ iterations, improving upon the $\\tilde{O}(\\kappa^{1.5}\\sqrt{d} + \\kappa
  d)$ runtime of prior work by a factor $(\\kappa/d)^{1/2}$ when the condition number
  $\\kappa$ is large. Our mixing time analysis introduces several techniques which
  to our knowledge have not appeared in the literature and may be of independent interest,
  including restrictions to a nonconvex set with good conductance behavior, and a
  new reduction technique for boosting a constant-accuracy total variation guarantee
  under weak warmness assumptions. This is the first high-accuracy mixing time result
  for logconcave distributions using only first-order function information which achieves
  linear dependence on $\\kappa$; we also give evidence that this dependence is likely
  to be necessary for standard Metropolized first-order methods."
