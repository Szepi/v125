title: 'On Linear Stochastic Approximation: Fine-grained Polyak-Ruppert and Non-Asymptotic
  Concentration'
abstract: "  We undertake a precise study of the asymptotic and non-asymptotic properties
  of stochastic approximation procedures with Polyak-Ruppert averaging for solving
  a linear system $\\bar{A} \\theta = \\bar{b}$. When the matrix $\\bar{A}$ is Hurwitz,
  we prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for the averaged iterates with fixed step
  size and number of iterations going to infinity. The CLT characterizes the exact
  asymptotic covariance matrix, which is the sum of the classical Polyak-Ruppert covariance
  and a correction term that scales with the step size. Under assumptions on the tail
  of the noise distribution, we prove a non-asymptotic concentration inequality whose
  main term matches the covariance in CLT in any direction, up to universal constants.
  When the matrix $\\bar{A}$ is not Hurwitz but only has non-negative real parts in
  its eigenvalues, we prove that the averaged LSA procedure actually achieves an $O(1/T)$
  rate in mean-squared error. Our results provide a more refined understanding of
  linear stochastic approximation in both the asymptotic and non-asymptotic settings.
  \ We also show various applications of the main results, including the study of
  momentum-based stochastic gradient methods as well as temporal difference algorithms
  in reinforcement learning."
