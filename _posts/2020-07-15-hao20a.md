title: Bessel Smoothing and Multi-Distribution Property Estimation
abstract: " We consider a basic problem in statistical learning: estimating properties
  of multiple discrete distributions. Denoting by $\\Delta_k$ the standard simplex
  over $[k]:=\\{0,1,\\ldots, k\\}$, a property of $d$ distributions is a mapping from
  $\\Delta_k^d$ to $\\mathbb R$. These properties include well-known distribution
  characteristics such as Shannon entropy and support size  ($d=1$), and many important
  divergence measures between distributions ($d=2$). The primary problem being considered
  is to learn the property value of an $\\emph{unknown}$ $d$-tuple of distributions
  from its sample. The study of such problems dates back to the works of Efron and
  Thisted (1976b); Thisted and Efron (1987); Good (1953b); Carlton (1969), and has
  been pushed forward steadily during the past decades. Surprisingly, before our work,
  the general landscape of this fundamental learning problem was insufficiently understood,
  and nearly all the existing results are for the special case $d\\le 2$. Our first
  main result provides a near-linear-time computable algorithm that, given independent
  samples from any collection of distributions and for a broad class of multi-distribution
  properties, learns the property as well as the empirical plug-in estimator that
  uses samples with logarithmic-factor larger sizes. As a corollary of this, for any
  $\\varepsilon>0$ and fixed $d\\in \\mathbb Z^+$, a $d$-distribution property over
  $[k]$ that is Lipschitz and additively separable can be learned to an accuracy of
  $\\varepsilon$ using a sample of size $\\mathcal{O}(k/(\\varepsilon^3\\sqrt{\\log
  k}))$, with high probability. Our second result addresses a closely related problemâ€“
  tolerant independence testing: One receives samples from the unknown joint and marginal
  distributions, and attempts to infer the $\\ell_1$ distance between the joint distribution
  and the product distribution of the marginals. We show that this testing problem
  also admits a sample complexity sub-linear in the alphabet sizes, demonstrating
  the broad applicability of our approach."
