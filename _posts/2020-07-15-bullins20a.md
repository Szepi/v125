title: Highly smooth minimization of non-smooth problems
abstract: " We establish improved rates for structured \\emph{non-smooth} optimization
  problems by means of near-optimal higher-order accelerated methods. In particular,
  given access to a standard oracle model that provides a $p^{th}$ order Taylor expansion
  of a \\emph{smoothed} version of the function, we show how to achieve $\\eps$-optimality
  for the \\emph{original} problem in $\\tilde{O}_p\\pa{\\eps^{-\\frac{2p+2}{3p+1}}}$
  calls to the oracle. Furthermore, when $p=3$, we provide an efficient implementation
  of the near-optimal accelerated scheme that achieves an $O(\\eps^{-4/5})$ iteration
  complexity, where each iteration requires $\\tilde{O}(1)$ calls to a linear system
  solver. Thus, we go beyond the previous $O(\\eps^{-1})$ barrier in terms of $\\eps$
  dependence, and in the case of $\\ell_\\infty$ regression and $\\ell_1$-SVM, we
  establish overall improvements for some parameter settings in the moderate-accuracy
  regime. Our results also lead to improved high-accuracy rates for minimizing a large
  class of convex quartic polynomials."
