title: Extending Learnability to Auxiliary-Input Cryptographic Primitives and Meta-PAC
  Learning
abstract: " We investigate the meaning of efficient learnability from several different
  perspectives. The purpose is to give new insights into central problems in computational
  learning theory (CoLT). Specifically, we discuss the following two questions related
  to efficient PAC learnability. First, we investigate the gap between PAC learnability
  for polynomial-size circuits and weak cryptographic primitives taking auxiliary-input.
  Applebaum et al. observed that such a weak primitive is enough to show the hardness
  of PAC learning. However, the opposite direction is still unknown. In this paper,
  we introduce the following two notions: (1) a variant model of PAC learning whose
  hardness corresponds to auxiliary-input one-way functions; (2) a variant of a hitting
  set generator corresponding to the hardness of PAC learning. The equivalence gives
  a clearer insight into the gap between the hardness of learning and weak cryptographic
  primitives. Second, we discuss why proving efficient learnability is difficult.
  This question is natural because few classes are known to be polynomially learnable
  at present. In this paper, we formulate a task of determining efficient learnability
  as a meta-PAC learning problem and show that our meta-PAC learning is exactly as
  hard as PAC learning. Our result insists on one possibility: a hard-to-learn instance
  itself yields the hardness of proving efficient learnability. Our technical contribution
  is to give (1) a general framework for translating the hardness of PAC learning
  into auxiliary-input primitives, and (2) a new formulation to discuss the hardness
  of determining efficient learnability. Our work yields new important frontiers related
  to CoLT, including investigation of the learning hierarchy. "
