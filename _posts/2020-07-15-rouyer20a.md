title: Tsallis-INF for Decoupled Exploration and Exploitation in Multi-armed Bandits
abstract: " We consider a variation of the multi-armed bandit problem, introduced
  by Avner et al. (2012), in which the forecaster is allowed to choose one arm to
  explore and one arm to exploit at every round. The loss of the exploited arm is
  blindly suffered by the forecaster, while the loss of the explored arm is observed
  without being suffered. The goal of the learner is to minimize the regret. We derive
  a new algorithm using regularization by Tsallis entropy to achieve best of both
  worlds guarantees. In the adversarial setting we show that the algorithm achieves
  the minimax optimal $O(\\sqrt{KT})$ regret bound, slightly improving on the result
  of Avner et al.. In the stochastic regime the algorithm achieves a time-independent
  regret bound, significantly improving on the result of Avner et al.. The algorithm
  also achieves the same time-independent regret bound in the more general stochastically
  constrained adversarial regime introduced by Wei and Luo (2018)."
