title: Provably efficient reinforcement learning with linear function approximation
abstract: " Modern Reinforcement Learning (RL) is commonly applied to practical problems
  with an enormous number of states, where \\emph{function approximation} must be
  deployed to approximate either the value function or the policy. The introduction
  of function approximation raises a fundamental set of challenges involving computational
  and statistical efficiency, especially given the need to manage the exploration/exploitation
  tradeoff. As a result, a core RL question remains open: how can we design provably
  efficient RL algorithms that incorporate function approximation? This question persists
  even in a basic setting with linear dynamics and linear rewards, for which only
  linear function approximation is needed. This paper presents the first provable
  RL algorithm with both polynomial runtime and polynomial sample complexity in this
  linear setting, without requiring a “simulator” or additional assumptions. Concretely,
  we prove that an optimistic modification of Least-Squares Value Iteration (LSVI)—a
  classical algorithm frequently studied in the linear setting—achieves $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{d^3H^3T})$
  regret, where $d$ is the ambient dimension of feature space, $H$ is the length of
  each episode, and $T$ is the total number of steps. Importantly, such regret is
  independent of the number of states and actions. "
