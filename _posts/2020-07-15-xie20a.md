title: Learning Zero-Sum Simultaneous-Move Markov Games Using Function Approximation
  and Correlated Equilibrium
abstract: " In this work, we develop provably efficient reinforcement learning algorithms
  for two-player zero-sum Markov games with  simultaneous moves. We consider a family
  of Markov games where the reward function and transition kernel possess a linear
  structure. Two settings are studied: In the offline setting, we control both players
  and the goal is to find the Nash Equilibrium efficiently by minimizing the worst-case
  duality gap.  In the online setting, we control a single player and  play against
  an arbitrary opponent; the goal is to minimize the regret. For both settings, we
  propose an optimistic variant of the least-squares minimax value iteration algorithm.
  We show that our algorithm is computationally efficient and provably achieves an
  $\\tilde O(\\sqrt{d^3 H^3 T} )$ upper bound on the duality gap and regret, without
  requiring additional assumptions on the sampling model. We highlight that our setting
  requires overcoming several new challenges that are absent in MDPs or turn-based
  Markov games. In particular,  to  achieve optimism under the simultaneous-move games,
  \ we construct both upper and lower confidence bounds of the value function, and
  then derive the optimistic policy by solving a general-sum matrix game with these
  bounds as the payoff matrices. As finding the Nash Equilibrium of this general-sum
  game is computationally hard, our algorithm instead solves for a Coarse Correlated
  Equilibrium (CCE), which can be obtained efficiently via linear programming. To
  our best knowledge, such a CCE-based mechanism for implementing optimism has not
  appeared in the literature and might be of interest in its own right."
