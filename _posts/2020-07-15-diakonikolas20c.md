title: Learning Halfspaces with Massart Noise Under Structured Distributions
abstract: " We study the problem of learning halfspaces with Massart noise in the
  distribution-specific PAC model. We give the first computationally efficient algorithm
  for this problem with respect to a broad family of distributions, including log-concave
  distributions. This resolves an open question posed in a number of prior works.
  Our approach is extremely simple: We identify a smooth {\\em non-convex} surrogate
  loss with the property that any approximate stationary point of this loss defines
  a halfspace that is close to the target halfspace. Given this structural result,
  we can use SGD to solve the underlying learning problem."
