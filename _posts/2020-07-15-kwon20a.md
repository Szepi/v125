title: The EM Algorithm gives Sample-Optimality for Learning Mixtures of Well-Separated
  Gaussians
abstract: " We consider the problem of spherical Gaussian Mixture models with $k \\geq
  3$ components when the components are well separated. A fundamental previous result
  established that separation of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log k})$ is necessary and sufficient
  for identifiability of the parameters with \\textit{polynomial} sample complexity
  (Regev and Vijayaraghavan, 2017). In the same context, we show that $\\tilde{O}
  (kd/\\epsilon^2)$ samples suffice for any $\\epsilon \\lesssim 1/k$, closing the
  gap from polynomial to linear, and thus giving the first optimal sample upper bound
  for the parameter estimation of well-separated Gaussian mixtures. We accomplish
  this by proving a new result for the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm: we
  show that EM converges locally, under separation $\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log k})$. The
  previous best-known guarantee required $\\Omega(\\sqrt{k})$ separation (Yan, et
  al., 2017). Unlike prior work, our results do not assume or use prior knowledge
  of the (potentially different) mixing weights or variances of the Gaussian components.
  Furthermore, our results show that the finite-sample error of EM does not depend
  on non-universal quantities such as pairwise distances between means of Gaussian
  components."
