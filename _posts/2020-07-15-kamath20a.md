title: Private Mean Estimation of Heavy-Tailed Distributions
abstract: " We give new upper and lower bounds on the minimax sample complexity of
  differentially private mean estimation of distributions with bounded $k$-th moments.
  Roughly speaking, in the univariate case, we show that $$n = \\Theta\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha^2}
  + \\frac{1}{\\alpha^{\\frac{k}{k-1}}\\varepsilon}\\right)$$ samples are necessary
  and sufficient to estimate the mean to $\\alpha$-accuracy under $\\varepsilon$-differential
  privacy, or any of its common relaxations. This result demonstrates a qualitatively
  different behavior compared to estimation absent privacy constraints, for which
  the sample complexity is identical for all $k \\geq 2$. We also give algorithms
  for the multivariate setting whose sample complexity is a factor of $O(d)$ larger
  than the univariate case."
