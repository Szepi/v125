title: The estimation error of general first order methods
abstract: " Modern large-scale statistical models require the estimation of thousands
  to millions of parameters. This is often accomplished by iterative algorithms such
  as gradient descent, projected gradient descent or their accelerated versions. What
  are the fundamental limits of these approaches? This question is well understood
  from an optimization viewpoint when the underlying objective is convex. Work in
  this area characterizes the gap to global optimality as a function of the number
  of iterations. However, these results have only indirect implications on the gap
  to \\emph{statistical} optimality. Here we consider two families of high-dimensional
  estimation problems: high-dimensional regression and low-rank matrix estimation,
  and introduce a class of ‘general first order methods’ that aim at efficiently estimating
  the underlying parameters. This class of algorithms is broad enough to include classical
  first order optimization (for convex and non-convex objectives), but also other
  types of algorithms. Under a random design assumption,  we derive lower bounds on
  the estimation error that hold in the high-dimensional asymptotics in which both
  the number of observations and the number of parameters diverge. These lower bounds
  are optimal in the sense that there exist algorithms in this class whose estimation
  \ error matches the lower bounds up to asymptotically negligible terms. We illustrate
  our general results through applications to sparse phase retrieval and sparse principal
  component analysis."
