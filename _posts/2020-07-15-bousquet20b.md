title: Sharper Bounds for Uniformly Stable Algorithms
abstract: " Deriving generalization bounds for stable algorithms is a classical question
  in learning theory taking its roots in the early works by Vapnik and Chervonenkis
  (1974) and Rogers and Wagner (1978). In a series of recent breakthrough papers by
  Feldman and Vondrak (2018, 2019), it was shown that the best known high probability
  upper bounds for uniformly stable learning algorithms due to Bousquet and Elisseef
  (2002) are sub-optimal in some natural regimes. To do so, they proved two generalization
  bounds that significantly outperform the simple generalization bound of Bousquet
  and Elisseef (2002). Feldman and Vondrak also asked if it is possible to provide
  sharper bounds and prove corresponding high probability lower bounds. This paper
  is devoted to these questions: firstly, inspired by  the original arguments of Feldman
  and Vondrak (2019), we provide a short proof of the moment bound that implies the
  generalization bound stronger than both recent results in Feldman and Vondrak (2018,
  2019). Secondly, we prove general lower bounds, showing that our moment bound is
  sharp (up to a logarithmic factor) unless some additional properties of the corresponding
  random variables are used. Our main probabilistic result is a general concentration
  inequality for weakly correlated random variables, which may be of independent interest."
