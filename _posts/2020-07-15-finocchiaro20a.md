title: Embedding Dimension of Polyhedral Losses
abstract: " A common technique in supervised learning with discrete losses, such as
  0-1 loss, is to optimize a convex surrogate loss over Rd, calibrated with respect
  to the original loss. In particular, recent work has investigated embedding the
  original predictions (e.g. labels) as points in Rd, showing an equivalence to using
  polyhedral surrogates. In this work, we study the notion of the embedding dimension
  of a given discrete loss: the minimum dimension d such that an embedding exists.
  We characterize d-embeddability for all d, with a particularly tight characterization
  for d=1 (embedding into the real line), and useful necessary conditions for d>1
  in the form of a quadratic feasibility program. We illustrate our results with novel
  lower bounds for abstain loss."
