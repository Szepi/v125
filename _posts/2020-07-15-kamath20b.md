title: 'Approximate is Good Enough: Probabilistic Variants of Dimensional and Margin
  Complexity'
abstract: " We present and study approximate notions of dimensional and margin complexity,
  which correspond to the minimal dimension or norm of an embedding required to {\\em
  approximate}, rather then exactly represent, a given hypothesis class.  We show
  that such notions are not only sufficient for learning using linear predictors or
  a kernel, but unlike the exact variants, are also necessary. Thus they are better
  suited for discussing limitations of linear or kernel methods."
