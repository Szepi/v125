title: A Closer Look at Small-loss Bounds for Bandits with Graph Feedback
abstract: " We study {\\it small-loss} bounds for adversarial multi-armed bandits
  with graph feedback, that is, adaptive regret bounds that depend on the loss of
  the best arm or related quantities, instead of the total number of rounds. We derive
  the first small-loss bound for general strongly observable graphs, resolving an
  open problem of Lykouris et al. (2018). Specifically, we develop an algorithm with
  regret $\\mathcal{\\tilde{O}}(\\sqrt{\\kappa L_*})$ where $\\kappa$ is the clique
  partition number and $L_*$ is the loss of the best arm, and for the special case
  of self-aware graphs where every arm has a self-loop, we improve the regret to $\\mathcal{\\tilde{O}}(\\min\\{\\sqrt{\\alpha
  T}, \\sqrt{\\kappa L_*}\\})$ where $\\alpha \\leq \\kappa$ is the independence number.
  Our results significantly improve and extend those by Lykouris et al. (2018) who
  only consider self-aware undirected graphs. Furthermore, we also take the first
  attempt at deriving small-loss bounds for weakly observable graphs. We first prove
  that no typical small-loss bounds are achievable in this case, and then propose
  algorithms with alternative small-loss bounds in terms of the loss of some specific
  subset of arms. A surprising side result is that $\\mathcal{\\tilde{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$
  regret is achievable even for weakly observable graphs as long as the best arm has
  a self-loop. Our algorithms are based on the Online Mirror Descent framework but
  require a suite of novel techniques that might be of independent interest. Moreover,
  all our algorithms can be made parameter-free without the knowledge of the environment."
