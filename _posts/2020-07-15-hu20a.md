title: 'Smooth Contextual Bandits: Bridging the Parametric and Non-differentiable
  Regret Regimes'
abstract: " We study a nonparametric contextual bandit problem where the expected
  reward functions belong to a HÃ¶lder class with smoothness parameter $\\beta$. We
  show how this interpolates between two extremes that were previously studied in
  isolation: non-differentiable bandits ($\\beta\\leq1$), where rate-optimal regret
  is achieved by running separate non-contextual bandits in different context regions,
  and parametric-response bandits (satisfying $\\beta=\\infty$), where rate-optimal
  regret can be achieved with minimal or no exploration due to infinite extrapolatability.
  We develop a novel algorithm that carefully adjusts to all smoothness settings and
  we prove its regret is rate-optimal by establishing matching upper and lower bounds,
  recovering the existing results at the two extremes. In this sense, our work bridges
  the gap between the existing literature on parametric and non-differentiable contextual
  bandit problems and between bandit algorithms that exclusively use global or local
  information, shedding light on the crucial interplay of complexity and regret in
  contextual bandits."
