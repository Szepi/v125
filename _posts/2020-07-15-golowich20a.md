title: Last Iterate is Slower than Averaged Iterate in Smooth Convex-Concave Saddle
  Point Problems
abstract: " In this paper we study the smooth convex-concave saddle point problem.
  Specifically, we analyze the last iterate convergence properties of the Extragradient
  (EG) algorithm. It is well known that the ergodic (averaged) iterates of EG converge
  at a rate of $O(1/T)$ (Nemirovski, 2004). In this paper, we show that the last iterate
  of EG converges at a rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$. To the best of our knowledge, this
  is the first paper to provide a convergence rate guarantee for the last iterate
  of EG for the smooth convex-concave saddle point problem. Moreover, we show that
  this rate is tight by proving a lower bound of $\\Omega(1/\\sqrt{T})$ for the last
  iterate. This lower bound therefore shows a quadratic separation of the convergence
  rates of ergodic and last iterates in smooth convex-concave saddle point problems."
