title: From Nesterov’s Estimate Sequence to Riemannian Acceleration
abstract: " We propose the first global accelerated gradient method for Riemannian
  manifolds. Toward establishing our results, we revisit Nesterov’s estimate sequence
  technique and develop a conceptually simple alternative from first principles. We
  then extend our analysis to Riemannian acceleration, localizing the key difficulty
  into “metric distortion.” We control this distortion via a novel geometric inequality,
  which enables us to formulate and analyze global Riemannian acceleration."
