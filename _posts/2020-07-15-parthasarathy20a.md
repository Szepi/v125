title: Adaptive Submodular Maximization under Stochastic Item Costs
abstract: " Constrained maximization of non-decreasing utility functions with submodularity-like
  properties is at the core of several AI and ML applications including viral marketing,
  pool-based active learning, adaptive feature selection, and sensor deployment. In
  this work, we develop adaptive policies for maximizing such functions when both
  the utility function and item costs may be stochastic. First, we study maximization
  of an adaptive weak submodular function which is submodular in an approximate and
  probabilistic sense, subject to a stochastic fractional knapsack constraint, which
  requires total expected item cost to be within a given capacity. We present the
  $\\beta$-GREEDY policy for this problem; our approximation guarantee for it recovers
  many known greedy maximization guarantees as special cases. Next, we study maximization
  of an adaptive submodular function, which is submodular in a probabilistic sense,
  subject to a stochastic knapsack constraint, which requires the total item cost
  to be within a given capacity with probability one. We present the MIX policy for
  this problem; our approximation guarantee for it is the first known approximation
  guarantee for maximizing a non-linear utility function subject to a stochastic knapsack
  constraint. Using alternative parameterizations of MIX, we also derive the first
  known approximation guarantees for maximizing an adaptive submodular function subject
  to a deterministic knapsack constraint. Our guarantees are powered by an innovative
  differential analysis technique which models the $\\beta$-GREEDY policy using a
  continuous-time stochastic reward process of a particle whose reward is related
  to the optimal utility through a differential inequality. The solution to this inequality
  yields our $\\beta$-GREEDY guarantee. We combine differential analysis with a variety
  of other ideas to derive our MIX guarantees."
