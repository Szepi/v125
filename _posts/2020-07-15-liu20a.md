title: Better Algorithms for Estimating Non-Parametric Models in Crowd-Sourcing and
  Rank Aggregation
abstract: " Motivated by applications in crowd-sourcing and rank aggregation, a recent
  line of work has studied the problem of estimating an $n \\times n$ bivariate isotonic
  matrix with an unknown permutation acting on its rows (and possibly another unknown
  permutation acting on its columns) from partial and noisy observations. There are
  wide and persistent computational vs. statistical gaps for this problem. It is known
  that the minimax optimal rate is $\\widetilde{O}(n^{-1})$ when error is measured
  in average squared Frobenius norm. However the best known polynomial time computable
  estimator due to \\cite{coltpaper} achieves the rate $\\widetilde{O}(n^{-\\frac{3}{4}})$,
  and this is the natural barrier to approaches based on using local statistics to
  figure out the relative order of pairs of rows without using information from the
  rest of the matrix. Here we introduce a framework for exploiting global information
  in shape-constrained estimation problems. In the case when only the rows are permuted,
  we give an algorithm that achieves error rate $O(n^{-1 + o(1)})$, which essentially
  closes the computational vs. statistical gap for this problem. When both the rows
  and columns are permuted, we give an improved algorithm that achieves error rate
  $O(n^{-\\frac{5}{6} + o(1)})$. Additionally, all of our algorithms run in nearly
  linear time.  "
