title: ID3 Learns Juntas for Smoothed Product Distributions
abstract: " In recent years, there are many attempts to understand popular heuristics.
  An example of such heuristic algorithm is the ID3 algorithm for learning decision
  trees. This algorithm is commonly used in practice, but there are very few theoretical
  works studying its behavior. In this paper, we analyze the ID3 algorithm, when the
  target function is a $k$-Junta, a function that depends on $k$ out of $n$ variables
  of the input. We prove that when $k = \\log n$, the ID3 algorithm learns in polynomial
  time $k$-Juntas, in the smoothed analysis model of Kalai and Teng (2008). That is,
  we show a learnability result  when the observed distribution is a “noisy” variant
  of the original distribution."
