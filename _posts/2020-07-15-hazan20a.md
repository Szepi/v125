title: Faster Projection-free Online Learning
abstract: " In many online learning problems the computational bottleneck for gradient-based
  methods is the  projection operation. For this reason, in many problems the most
  efficient algorithms are based on the Frank-Wolfe method, which replaces projections
  by linear optimization. In the general case, however, online projection-free methods
  require more iterations than projection-based methods: the best known regret bound
  scales as $T^{3/4}$. Despite significant work on various variants of the Frank-Wolfe
  method, this bound has remained unchanged for a decade. In this paper we give an
  efficient projection-free algorithm that guarantees $T^{2/3}$ regret for general
  online convex optimization with smooth cost functions and one linear optimization
  computation per iteration. As opposed to previous Frank-Wolfe approaches, our algorithm
  is derived using the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader method and is analyzed using an
  online primal-dual framework."
