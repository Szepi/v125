title: Finite-Time Analysis of Asynchronous Stochastic Approximation and $Q$-Learning
abstract: " We consider a general asynchronous Stochastic Approximation (SA) scheme
  featuring a weighted infinity-norm contractive operator, and prove a bound on its
  finite-time convergence rate on a single trajectory. Additionally, we specialize
  the result to asynchronous $Q$-learning. The resulting bound matches the sharpest
  available bound for synchronous $Q$-learning, and improves over previous known bounds
  for asynchronous $Q$-learning."
