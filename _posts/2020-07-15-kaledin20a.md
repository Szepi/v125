title: Finite Time Analysis of Linear Two-timescale Stochastic Approximation with
  Markovian Noise
abstract: " Linear two-timescale stochastic approximation (SA) scheme is an important
  class of algorithms which has become popular in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly
  for the policy evaluation problem. Recently, a number of works have been devoted
  to establishing the finite time analysis of the scheme, especially under the Markovian
  (non-i.i.d.) noise settings that are ubiquitous in practice. In this paper, we provide
  a finite-time  analysis for linear two timescale SA. Our bounds show that there
  is no discrepancy in the convergence rate between Markovian and martingale noise,
  only the constants are affected by the mixing time of the Markov chain. With an
  appropriate step size schedule, the transient term in the expected error bound is
  $o(1/k^c)$ and the steady-state term is ${\\cal O}(1/k)$, where $c>1$ and $k$ is
  the iteration number. Furthermore, we present an asymptotic expansion of the expected
  error with a matching lower bound of $\\Omega(1/k)$. A simple numerical experiment
  is presented to support our theory."
