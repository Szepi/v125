title: Nearly Non-Expansive Bounds for Mahalanobis Hard Thresholding
abstract: " Given a vector $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ and a positive semi-definite matrix
  $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p\\times p}$, we study the expansion ratio bound for the following
  defined Mahalanobis hard thresholding operator of $w$: \\[ \\mathcal{H}_{A,k}(w):=\\argmin_{\\|\\theta\\|_0\\le
  k} \\frac{1}{2}\\|\\theta - w\\|^2_A, \\]{where} $k\\le p$ is the desired sparsity
  level. The core contribution of this paper is to prove that for any $\\bar k$-sparse
  vector $\\bar w$ with $\\bar k < k$, the estimation error $\\|\\mathcal{H}_{A,k}(w)
  -  \\bar w\\|_A$ satisfies \\[ \\|\\mathcal{H}_{A,k}(w) -  \\bar w\\|^2_A \\le \\left(1+
  \\mathcal{O}\\left(\\kappa(A,2k) \\sqrt{\\frac{\\bar k }{k - \\bar k}}\\right)\\right)
  \\|{w} - \\bar w\\|^2_A, \\]{where} $\\kappa(A,2k)$ is the restricted strong condition
  number of $A$ over $(2k)$-sparse subspace. This estimation error bound is nearly
  non-expansive when $k$ is sufficiently larger than $\\bar k$. Specially when $A$
  is the identity matrix such that $\\kappa(A,2k)\\equiv1$, our bound recovers the
  previously known nearly non-expansive bounds for Euclidean hard thresholding operator.
  We further show that such a bound extends to an approximate version of $\\mathcal{H}_{A,k}(w)$
  estimated by Hard Thresholding Pursuit (HTP) algorithm. We demonstrate the applicability
  of these bounds to the mean squared error analysis of HTP and its novel extension
  based on preconditioning method. Numerical evidence is provided to support our theory
  and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed preconditioning HTP algorithm. "
