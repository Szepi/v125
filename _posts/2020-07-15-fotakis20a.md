title: Efficient Parameter Estimation of Truncated Boolean Product Distributions
abstract: " We study the problem of estimating the parameters of a Boolean product
  distribution in $d$ dimensions, when the samples are truncated by a set $S \\subset
  \\{0, 1\\}^d$ accessible through a membership oracle. This is the first time that
  the computational and statistical complexity of learning from truncated samples
  is considered in a discrete setting. We introduce a natural notion of \\emph{fatness}
  of the truncation set $S$, under which truncated samples reveal enough information
  about the true distribution. We show that if the truncation set is sufficiently
  fat, samples from the true distribution can be generated from truncated samples.
  A stunning consequence is that virtually any statistical task (e.g., learning in
  total variation distance, parameter estimation, uniformity or identity testing)
  that can be performed efficiently for Boolean product distributions, can also be
  performed from truncated samples, with a small increase in sample complexity. We
  generalize our approach to ranking distributions over $d$ alternatives, where we
  show how fatness implies efficient parameter estimation of Mallows models from truncated
  samples. Exploring the limits of learning discrete models from truncated samples,
  we identify three natural conditions that are necessary for efficient identifiability:
  (i) the truncation set $S$ should be rich enough; (ii) $S$ should be accessible
  through membership queries; and (iii) the truncation by $S$ should leave enough
  randomness in all directions. By carefully adapting the Stochastic Gradient Descent
  approach of (Daskalakis et al., FOCS 2018), we show that these conditions are also
  sufficient for efficient learning of truncated Boolean product distributions."
