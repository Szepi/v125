title: Complexity Guarantees for Polyak Steps with Momentum
abstract: " In smooth strongly convex optimization, knowledge of the strong convexity
  parameter is critical for obtaining simple methods with accelerated rates. In this
  work, we study a class of methods, based on Polyak steps, where this knowledge is
  substituted by that of the optimal value, $f_*$. We first show slightly improved
  convergence bounds than previously known for the classical case of simple gradient
  descent with Polyak steps, we then derive an accelerated gradient method with Polyak
  steps and momentum, along with convergence guarantees."
