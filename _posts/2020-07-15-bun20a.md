title: Efficient, Noise-Tolerant, and Private Learning via Boosting
abstract: " We introduce a simple framework for designing private boosting algorithms.
  We give natural conditions under which these algorithms are differentially private,
  efficient, and noise-tolerant PAC learners. To demonstrate our framework, we use
  it to construct noise-tolerant and private PAC learners for large-margin halfspaces
  whose sample complexity does not depend on the dimension. We give two sample complexity
  bounds for our large-margin halfspace learner. One bound is based only on differential
  privacy, and uses this guarantee as an asset for ensuring generalization. This first
  bound illustrates a general methodology for obtaining PAC learners from privacy,
  which may be of independent interest. The second bound uses standard techniques
  from the theory of large-margin classification (the fat-shattering dimension) to
  match the best known sample complexity for differentially private learning of large-margin
  halfspaces, while additionally tolerating random label noise."
