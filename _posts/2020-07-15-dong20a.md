title: Root-n-Regret for Learning in Markov Decision Processes with Function Approximation
  and Low Bellman Rank
abstract: " In this paper, we consider the problem of online learning of Markov decision
  processes (MDPs) with very large state spaces. Under the assumptions of realizable
  function approximation and low Bellman ranks, we develop an online learning algorithm
  that learns the optimal value function while at the same time achieving very low
  cumulative regret during the learning process. Our learning algorithm, Adaptive
  Value-function Elimination (AVE), is inspired by the policy elimination algorithm
  proposed in (Jiang et al., 2017), known as OLIVE. One of our key technical contributions
  in AVE is to formulate the elimination steps in OLIVE as contextual bandit problems.
  This technique enables us to apply the active elimination and expert weighting methods
  from (Dudik et al., 2011), instead of the random action exploration scheme used
  in the original OLIVE algorithm, for more efficient exploration and better control
  of the regret incurred in each policy elimination step. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first root-n-regret result for reinforcement learning in stochastic
  MDPs with general value function approximation."
