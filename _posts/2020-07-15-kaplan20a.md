title: 'Privately Learning Thresholds: Closing the Exponential Gap'
abstract: " We study the sample complexity of learning threshold functions under the
  constraint of differential privacy. It is assumed that each labeled example in the
  training data is the information of one individual and we would like to come up
  with a generalizing hypothesis $h$ while guaranteeing differential privacy for the
  individuals. Intuitively, this means that any single labeled example in the training
  data should not have a significant effect on the choice of the hypothesis. This
  problem has received much attention recently; unlike the non-private case, where
  the sample complexity is independent of the domain size and just depends on the
  desired accuracy and confidence, for private learning the sample complexity must
  depend on the domain size $X$ (even for approximate differential privacy). Alon
  et al. (STOC 2019) showed a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\log^*|X|)$  on the sample
  complexity and Bun et al. (FOCS 2015) presented an approximate-private learner with
  sample complexity $\\tilde{O}\\left(2^{\\log^*|X|}\\right)$. In this work we reduce
  this gap significantly, almost settling the sample complexity. We first present
  a new upper bound (algorithm) of $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\left(\\log^*|X|\\right)^2\\right)$
  on the sample complexity  and then present an improved version with sample complexity
  $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\left(\\log^*|X|\\right)^{1.5}\\right)$. Our algorithm is constructed
  for the related interior point problem, where the goal is to find a point between
  the largest and smallest input elements. It is based on selecting an input-dependent
  hash function and using it to embed the database into a domain whose size is reduced
  logarithmically; this results in a new database, an interior point of which can
  be used to generate an interior point of the original database in a differentially
  private manner."
