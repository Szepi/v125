title: The Influence of Shape Constraints on the Thresholding Bandit Problem
abstract: " We investigate the stochastic \\emph{Thresholding Bandit problem} (\\textit{TBP})
  under several \\emph{shape constraints}. On top of (i) the vanilla, unstructured
  \\textit{TBP}, we consider the case where (ii) the sequence of armâ€™s means $(\\mu_k)_k$
  is monotonically increasing \\textit{MTBP}, (iii) the case where $(\\mu_k)_k$ is
  unimodal \\textit{UTBP} and (iv) the case where $(\\mu_k)_k$ is concave \\textit{CTBP}.
  In the \\textit{TBP} problem the aim is to output, at the end of the sequential
  game, the set of arms whose means are above a given threshold. The regret is the
  highest gap between a misclassified arm and the threshold. In the fixed budget setting,
  we provide \\emph{problem independent} minimax rates for the expected regret in
  all settings, as well as associated algorithms. We prove that the minimax rates
  for the regret are (i) $\\sqrt{\\log(K)K/T}$ for \\textit{TBP}, (ii) $\\sqrt{\\log(K)/T}$
  for \\textit{MTBP}, (iii) $\\sqrt{K/T}$ for \\textit{UTBP} and (iv) $\\sqrt{\\log\\log
  K/T}$ for \\textit{CTBP}, where $K$ is the number of arms and $T$ is the budget.
  These rates demonstrate that \\textit{the dependence on $K$} of the minimax regret
  varies significantly depending on the shape constraint. This highlights the fact
  that the shape constraints modify fundamentally the nature of the \\textit{TBP}."
