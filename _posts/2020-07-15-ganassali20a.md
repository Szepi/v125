title: From tree matching to sparse graph alignment
abstract: " In this paper we consider alignment of sparse graphs, for which we introduce
  the Neighborhood Tree Matching Algorithm (NTMA). For correlated Erdős-R{é}nyi random
  graphs, we prove that the algorithm returns – in polynomial time – a positive fraction
  of correctly matched vertices, and a vanishing fraction of mismatches. This result
  holds with average degree of the graphs in $O(1)$ and correlation parameter $s$
  that can be bounded away from $1$, conditions under which random graph alignment
  is particularly challenging. As a byproduct of the analysis we introduce a matching
  metric between trees and characterize it for several models of correlated random
  trees. These results may be of independent interest, yielding for instance efficient
  tests for determining whether two random trees are correlated or independent."
