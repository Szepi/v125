title: 'Open Problem: Average-Case Hardness of Hypergraphic Planted Clique Detection'
abstract: We note the significance of hypergraphic planted clique (HPC) detection
  in the investigation of computational hardness for a range of tensor problems. We
  ask if more evidence for the computational hardness of HPC detection can be developed.
  In particular, we conjecture if it is possible to establish the equivalence of the
  computational hardness between HPC and PC detection.
