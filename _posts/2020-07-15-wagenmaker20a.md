title: Active Learning for Identification of Linear Dynamical Systems
abstract: " We propose an algorithm to actively estimate the parameters of a linear
  dynamical system. Given complete control over the systemâ€™s input, our algorithm
  adaptively chooses the inputs to accelerate estimation. We show a finite time bound
  quantifying the estimation rate our algorithm attains and prove matching upper and
  lower bounds which guarantee its asymptotic optimality, up to constants. In addition,
  we show that this optimal rate is unattainable when using Gaussian noise to excite
  the system, even with optimally tuned covariance, and analyze several examples where
  our algorithm provably improves over rates obtained by playing noise. Our analysis
  critically relies on a novel result quantifying the error in estimating the parameters
  of a dynamical system when arbitrary periodic inputs are being played. We conclude
  with numerical examples that illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in practice. "
