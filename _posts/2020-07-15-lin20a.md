title: Near-Optimal Algorithms for Minimax Optimization
abstract: " This paper resolves a longstanding open question pertaining to the design
  of near-optimal first-order algorithms for smooth and strongly-convex-strongly-concave
  minimax problems. Current state-of-the-art first-order algorithms find an approximate
  Nash equilibrium using $\\tilde{O}(\\kappa_x+\\kappa_y)$
  or $\\tilde{O}(\\text{min}\\{\\kappa_x\\sqrt{\\kappa_y}, \\sqrt{\\kappa_x}\\kappa_y\\})$Â 
  gradient evaluations, where $\\kappa_x$ and $\\kappa_y$ are the condition numbers
  for the strong-convexity and strong-concavity assumptions. A gap still remains between
  these results and the best existing lower bound $\\tilde{\\Omega}(\\sqrt{\\kappa_x\\kappa_y})$.  This paper presents the first algorithm with $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\kappa_x\\kappa_y})$
  gradient complexity, matching the lower bound up to logarithmic factors. Our algorithm
  is designed based on an accelerated proximal point method and an accelerated solver
  for minimax proximal steps.  It can be easily extended to the settings of strongly-convex-concave,
  convex-concave, nonconvex-strongly-concave, and nonconvex-concave functions. This
  paper also presents algorithms that match or outperform all existing methods in
  these settings in terms of gradient complexity, up to logarithmic factors."
