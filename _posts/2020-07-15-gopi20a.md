title: Locally Private Hypothesis Selection
abstract: " We initiate the study of hypothesis selection under local differential
  privacy. Given samples from an unknown probability distribution $p$ and a set of
  $k$ probability distributions $\\mathcal{Q}$, we aim to output, under the constraints
  of $\\varepsilon$-differential privacy, a distribution from $\\mathcal{Q}$ whose
  total variation distance to $p$ is comparable to the best such distribution. This
  is a generalization of the classic problem of $k$-wise simple hypothesis testing,
  which corresponds to when $p \\in \\mathcal{Q}$, and we wish to identify $p$. Absent
  privacy constraints, this problem requires $O(\\log k)$ samples from $p$, and it
  was recently shown that the same complexity is achievable under (central) differential
  privacy. However, the naive approach to this problem under local differential privacy
  would require $\\tilde O(k^2)$ samples. We first show that the constraint of local
  differential privacy incurs an exponential increase in cost: any algorithm for this
  problem requires at least $\\Omega(k)$ samples. Second, for the special case of
  $k$-wise simple hypothesis testing, we provide a non-interactive algorithm which
  nearly matches this bound, requiring $\\tilde O(k)$ samples. Finally, we provide
  sequentially interactive algorithms for the general case, requiring $\\tilde O(k)$
  samples and only $O(\\log \\log k)$ rounds of interactivity. Our algorithms are
  achieved through a reduction to maximum selection with adversarial comparators,
  a problem of independent interest for which we initiate study in the parallel setting.
  For this problem, we provide a family of algorithms for each number of allowed rounds
  of interaction $t$, as well as lower bounds showing that they are near-optimal for
  every $t$. Notably, our algorithms result in exponential improvements on the round
  complexity of previous methods."
