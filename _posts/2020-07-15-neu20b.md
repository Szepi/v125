title: Efficient and robust algorithms for adversarial linear contextual bandits
abstract: " We consider an adversarial variant of the classic $K$-armed linear contextual
  bandit problem where the sequence of loss functions associated with each arm are
  allowed to change without restriction over time. Under the assumption that the $d$-dimensional
  contexts are generated i.i.d.Â at random from a known distribution, we develop computationally
  efficient algorithms based on the classic Exp3 algorithm. Our first algorithm, RealLinExp3,
  is shown to achieve a regret guarantee of $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{KdT})$ over $T$
  rounds, which matches the best known lower bound for this problem. Our second algorithm,
  RobustLinExp3, is shown to be robust to misspecification, in that it achieves a
  regret bound of $\\widetilde{O}((Kd)^{1/3}T^{2/3}) + \\varepsilon \\sqrt{d} T$ if
  the true reward function is linear up to an additive nonlinear error uniformly bounded
  in absolute value by $\\varepsilon$. To our knowledge, our performance guarantees
  constitute the very first results on this problem setting."
