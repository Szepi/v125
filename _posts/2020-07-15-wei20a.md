title: 'Taking a hint: How to leverage loss predictors in contextual bandits?'
abstract: " We initiate the study of learning in contextual bandits with the help
  of loss predictors. The main question we address is whether one can improve over
  the minimax regret $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ for learning over $T$ rounds, when
  the total error of the predicted losses relative to the realized losses, denoted
  as $\\mathcal{E} \\leq T$, is relatively small. We provide a complete answer to
  this question, with upper and lower bounds for various settings: adversarial and
  stochastic environments, known and unknown $\\mathcal{E}$, and single and multiple
  predictors. We show several surprising results, such as 1) the optimal regret is
  $\\mathcal{O}(\\min\\{\\sqrt{T}, \\sqrt{\\mathcal{E}}T^\\frac{1}{4}\\})$ when $\\mathcal{E}$
  is known, in contrast to the standard and better bound $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\mathcal{E}})$
  for non-contextual problems (such as multi-armed bandits); 2) the same bound cannot
  be achieved if $\\mathcal{E}$ is unknown, but as a remedy, $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\mathcal{E}}T^\\frac{1}{3})$
  is achievable; 3) with $M$ predictors, a linear dependence on $M$ is necessary,
  even though logarithmic dependence is possible for non-contextual problems. We also
  develop several novel algorithmic techniques to achieve matching upper bounds, including
  1) a key \\emph{action  remapping} technique for optimal regret with known $\\mathcal{E}$,
  2) computationally efficient implementation of Catoniâ€™s robust mean estimator via
  an ERM oracle in the stochastic setting with optimal regret, 3) an underestimator
  for $\\mathcal{E}$ via estimating the histogram with bins of exponentially increasing
  size for the stochastic setting with unknown $\\mathcal{E}$, and 4) a self-referential
  scheme for learning with multiple predictors, all of which might be of independent
  interest. "
