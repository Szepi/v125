title: Calibrated Surrogate Losses for Adversarially Robust Classification
abstract: " Adversarially robust classification seeks a classifier that is insensitive
  to adversarial perturbations of test patterns. This problem is often formulated
  via a minimax objective, where the target loss is the worst-case value of the 0-1
  loss subject to a bound on the size of perturbation. Recent work has proposed convex
  surrogates for the adversarial 0-1 loss, in an effort to make optimization more
  tractable. In this work, we consider the question of which surrogate losses are
  \\emph{calibrated} with respect to the adversarial 0-1 loss, meaning that minimization
  of the former implies minimization of the latter. We show that no convex surrogate
  loss is calibrated with respect to the adversarial 0-1 loss when restricted to the
  class of linear models. We further introduce a class of nonconvex losses and offer
  necessary and sufficient conditions for losses in this class to be calibrated. "
