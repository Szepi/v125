title: Tree-projected gradient descent for estimating gradient-sparse parameters on
  graphs
abstract: " We study estimation of a gradient-sparse parameter vector $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^*
  \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$, having strong gradient-sparsity $s^*:=\\|\\nabla_G \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^*\\|_0$
  on an underlying graph $G$. Given observations $Z_1,\\ldots,Z_n$ and a smooth, convex
  loss function $\\mathcal{L}$ for which $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^*$ minimizes the population
  risk $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta};Z_1,\\ldots,Z_n)]$, we propose
  to estimate $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^*$ by a projected gradient descent algorithm
  that iteratively and approximately projects gradient steps onto spaces of vectors
  having small gradient-sparsity over low-degree spanning trees of $G$. We show that,
  under suitable restricted strong convexity and smoothness assumptions for the loss,
  the resulting estimator achieves the squared-error risk $\\frac{s^*}{n} \\log (1+\\frac{p}{s^*})$
  up to a multiplicative constant that is independent of $G$. In contrast, previous
  polynomial-time algorithms have only been shown to achieve this guarantee in more
  specialized settings, or under additional assumptions for $G$ and/or the sparsity
  pattern of $\\nabla_G \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^*$. As applications of our general framework,
  we apply our results to the examples of linear models and generalized linear models
  with random design."
