title: Estimating Principal Components under Adversarial Perturbations
abstract: " Robustness is a key requirement for widespread deployment of machine learning
  algorithms, and has received much attention in both statistics and computer science.
  We study a natural model of robustness for high-dimensional statistical estimation
  problems that we call the {\\em adversarial perturbation model}. An adversary can
  perturb {\\em every} sample arbitrarily up to a specified magnitude $\\delta$ measured
  in some $\\ell_q$ norm, say $\\ell_\\infty$. Our model is motivated by emerging
  paradigms such as {\\em low precision machine learning} and {\\em adversarial training}.
  We study the classical problem of estimating the top-$r$ principal subspace of the
  Gaussian covariance matrix in high dimensions, under the adversarial perturbation
  model. We design a computationally efficient algorithm that given corrupted data,
  recovers an estimate of the top-$r$ principal subspace with error that depends on
  a robustness parameter $\\kappa$ that we identify. This parameter corresponds to
  the $q \\to 2$ operator norm of the projector onto the principal subspace, and generalizes
  well-studied analytic notions of sparsity. Additionally, in the absence of corruptions,
  our algorithmic guarantees recover existing bounds for problems such as sparse PCA
  and its higher rank analogs. We also prove that the above dependence on the parameter
  $\\kappa$ is almost optimal asymptotically, not just in a minimax sense, but remarkably
  for {\\em every} instance of the problem. This  {\\em instance-optimal} guarantee
  shows that the $q \\to 2$ operator norm of the subspace essentially {\\em characterizes}
  the estimation error under adversarial perturbations."
