title: Robust causal inference under covariate shift via worst-case subpopulation
  treatment effects
abstract: " We propose a notion of worst-case treatment effect (WTE) across all subpopulations
  of a given size, a conservative notion of topline treatment effect. Compared to
  the average treatment effect (ATE) that solely relies on the covariate distribution
  of collected data, WTE is robust to unanticipated covariate shifts, and ensures
  reliable inference uniformly over underrepresented minority groups. We develop a
  semiparametrically efficient estimator for the WTE, leveraging machine learning-based
  estimates of heterogenous treatment effects and propensity scores. By virtue of
  satisfying a key (Neyman) orthogonality property, our estimator enjoys central limit
  behavior—oracle rates with true nuisance parameters—even when estimates of nuisance
  parameters converge at slower-than-parameteric rates.  In particular, this allows
  using black-box machine learning methods to construct asymptotically exact confidence
  intervals for the WTE.  For both observational and randomized studies, we prove
  that our estimator achieves the \\emph{optimal} asymptotic variance, by establishing
  a semiparametric efficiency lower bound. On real datasets, we illustrate the non-robustness
  of ATE under even small amounts distributional shift, and demonstrate that WTE allows
  us to guard against brittle findings that are invalidated by unanticipated covariate
  shifts. "
