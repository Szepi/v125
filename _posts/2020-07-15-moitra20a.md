title: Parallels Between Phase Transitions and Circuit Complexity?
abstract: "  In many natural average-case problems, there are or there are believed
  to be critical values in the parameter space where the structure of the space of
  solutions changes in a fundamental way. These phase transitions are often believed
  to coincide with drastic changes in the computational complexity of the associated
  problem. In this work, we study the circuit complexity of inference in the broadcast
  tree model, which has important applications in phylogenetic reconstruction and
  close connections to community detection. We establish a number of qualitative connections
  between phase transitions and circuit complexity in this model. Specifically we
  show that there is a $\\mathbf{TC}^0$ circuit that competes with the Bayes optimal
  predictor in some range of parameters above the Kesten-Stigum bound. We also show
  that there is a $16$ label broadcast tree model beneath the Kesten-Stigum bound
  in which it is possible to accurately guess the label of the root, but beating random
  guessing is $\\mathbf{NC}^1$-hard on average. The key to locating phase transitions
  is often to study some intrinsic notions of complexity associated with belief propagation
  \\â€” e.g. where do linear statistics fail, or when is the posterior sensitive to
  noise? Ours is the first work to study the complexity of belief propagation in a
  way that is grounded in circuit complexity."
