title: Rigorous Guarantees for Tyler’s M-Estimator via Quantum Expansion
abstract: "  Estimating the shape of an elliptical distribution is a fundamental problem
  in statistics. One estimator for the shape matrix, Tyler’s M-estimator, has been
  shown to have many appealing asymptotic properties. It performs well in numerical
  experiments and can be quickly computed in practice by a simple iterative procedure.
  Despite the many years the estimator has been studied in the statistics community,
  there was neither a non-asymptotic bound on the rate of the estimator nor a proof
  that the iterative procedure converges in polynomially many steps. Here we observe
  a surprising connection between Tyler’s M-estimator and operator scaling, which
  has been intensively studied in recent years in part because of its connections
  to the Brascamp-Lieb inequality in analysis. We use this connection, together with
  novel results on quantum expanders, to show that Tyler’s M-estimator has the optimal
  rate up to factors logarithmic in the dimension, and that in the generative model
  the iterative procedure has a linear convergence rate even without regularization."
