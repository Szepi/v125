title: ODE-Inspired Analysis for the Biological Version of Oja’s Rule in Solving Streaming
  PCA
abstract: " Oja’s rule [Oja, Journal of mathematical biology 1982] is a well-known
  biologically-plausible algorithm using a Hebbian-type synaptic update rule to solve
  streaming principal component analysis (PCA). Computational neuroscientists have
  known that this biological version of Oja’s rule converges to the top eigenvector
  of the covariance matrix of the input in the limit. However, prior to this work,
  it was open to prove any convergence rate guarantee. In this work, we give the first
  convergence rate analysis for the biological version of Oja’s rule in solving streaming
  PCA. Moreover, our convergence rate matches the information theoretical lower bound
  up to logarithmic factors and outperforms the state-of-the-art upper bound for streaming
  PCA. Furthermore, we develop a novel framework inspired by ordinary differential
  equations (ODE) to analyze general stochastic dynamics. The framework abandons the
  traditional \\textit{step-by-step} analysis and instead analyzes a stochastic dynamic
  in \\textit{one-shot} by giving a closed-form solution to the entire dynamic. The
  one-shot framework allows us to apply stopping time and martingale techniques to
  have a flexible and precise control on the dynamic. We believe that this general
  framework is powerful and should lead to effective yet simple analysis for a large
  class of problems with stochastic dynamics."
