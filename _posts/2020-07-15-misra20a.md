title: Information Theoretic Optimal Learning of Gaussian Graphical Models
abstract: " What is the optimal number of independent observations from which a sparse
  Gaussian Graphical Model can be correctly recovered? Information-theoretic arguments
  provide a lower bound on the minimum number of samples necessary to perfectly identify
  the support of any multivariate normal distribution as a function of model parameters.
  For a model defined on a sparse graph with $p$ nodes, a maximum degree $d$ and minimum
  normalized edge strength $\\kappa$, this necessary number of samples scales at least
  as $d \\log p/\\kappa^2$. The sample complexity requirements of existing methods
  for perfect graph reconstruction exhibit dependency on additional parameters that
  do not enter in the lower bound. The question of whether the  lower bound is tight
  and achievable by a polynomial time algorithm remains open. In this paper, we constructively
  answer this question and propose an algorithm, termed DICE, whose sample complexity
  matches the information-theoretic lower bound up to a universal constant factor.
  We also propose a related algorithm SLICE that has a slightly higher sample complexity,
  but can be implemented as a mixed integer quadratic program which makes it attractive
  in practice. Importantly, SLICE retains a critical advantage of DICE in that its
  sample complexity only depends on quantities present in the information theoretic
  lower bound. We anticipate that this result will stimulate future search of computationally
  efficient sample-optimal algorithms."
