title: Consistent recovery threshold of hidden nearest neighbor graphs
abstract: " Motivated by applications such as discovering strong ties in social networks
  and assembling genome subsequences in biology, we study the problem of recovering
  a hidden $2k$-nearest neighbor (NN) graph in an $n$-vertex complete graph, whose
  edge weights are independent and distributed according to $P_n$ for edges in the
  hidden $2k$-NN graph and $Q_n$ otherwise. The special case of Bernoulli distributions
  corresponds to a variant of the Watts-Strogatz small-world graph. We focus on two
  types of asymptotic recovery guarantees as $n\\to \\infty$: (1) exact recovery:
  all edges are classified correctly with probability tending to one; (2) almost exact
  recovery: the expected number of misclassified edges is $o(nk)$. We show that the
  maximum likelihood estimator achieves (1) exact recovery for $2 \\le k \\le n^{o(1)}$
  if $ \\liminf \\frac{2\\alpha_n}{\\log n}>1$; (2) almost exact recovery for $ 1
  \\le k \\le o\\left( \\frac{\\log n}{\\log \\log n} \\right)$ if $ \\liminf \\frac{kD(P_n||Q_n)}{\\log
  n}>1, $ where $\\alpha_n \\triangleq -2 \\log \\int \\sqrt{d P_n d Q_n}$ is the
  RÃ©nyi divergence of order $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $D(P_n||Q_n)$ is the Kullback-Leibler
  divergence. Under mild distributional assumptions, these conditions are shown to
  be information-theoretically necessary for any algorithm to succeed. A key challenge
  in the analysis is the enumeration of $2k$-NN graphs that differ from the hidden
  one by a given number of edges. We also analyze several computationally efficient
  algorithms and provide sufficient conditions under which they achieve exact/almost
  exact recovery. In particular, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm that attains
  the threshold for exact recovery under the small-world model."
