title: Non-asymptotic Analysis for Nonparametric Testing
abstract: " We develop a non-asymptotic framework for hypothesis testing in nonparametric
  regression where the true regression function belongs to a Sobolev space. Our statistical
  guarantees are exact in the sense that Type I and II errors are controlled for any
  finite sample size. Meanwhile, one proposed test is shown to achieve minimax rate
  optimality in the asymptotic sense. An important consequence of this non-asymptotic
  theory is a new and practically useful formula for selecting the optimal smoothing
  parameter in the testing statistic. Extensions of our results to general reproducing
  kernel Hilbert spaces and non-Gaussian error regression are also discussed."
