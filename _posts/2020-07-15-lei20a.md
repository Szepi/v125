title: A Fast Spectral Algorithm for Mean Estimation with Sub-Gaussian Rates
abstract: " We study the algorithmic problem of estimating the mean of a heavy-tailed
  random vector in R^d, given n i.i.d. samples. The goal is to design an efficient
  estimator that attains the optimal sub-gaussian error bound, only assuming that
  the random vector has bounded mean and covariance. Polynomial-time solutions to
  this problem are known but have high runtime due to their use of semi-definite programming
  (SDP). Moreover, conceptually, it remains open whether convex relaxation is truly
  necessary for this problem. In this work, we show that it is possible to go beyond
  SDP and achieve better computational efficiency. In particular, we provide a spectral
  algorithm that achieves the optimal statistical performance and runs in time O (
  n^2 d ), improving upon the previous fastest runtime O( n^{3.5}+ n^2 d ) by Cherapanamjeri
  et.al. (COLT ’19). Our algorithm is spectral in that it only requires (approximate)
  eigenvector computations, which can be implemented very efficiently by, for example,
  power iteration or the Lanczos method. At the core of our algorithm is a novel connection
  between the furthest hyperplane problem introduced by Karnin et. al. (COLT ’12)
  and a structural lemma on heavy-tailed distributions by Lugosi and Mendelson (Ann.
  Stat. ’19). This allows us to iteratively reduce the estimation error at a geometric
  rate using only the information derived from the top singular vector of the data
  matrix, leading to a significantly faster running time."
