title: Bounds in query learning
abstract: " We introduce new combinatorial quantities for concept classes, and prove
  lower and upper bounds for learning complexity in several models of learning in
  terms of various combinatorial quantities. In the setting of equivalence plus membership
  queries, we give an algorithm which learns a class in polynomially many queries
  whenever any such algorithm exists. Our approach is flexible and powerful enough
  to give new and very short proofs of the efficient learnability of several prominent
  examples (e.g. regular languages and regular $\\omega$-languages), in some cases
  also producing new bounds on the number of queries."
