title: No-Regret Prediction in Marginally Stable Systems
abstract: " We consider the problem of online prediction in a marginally stable linear
  dynamical system subject to bounded adversarial or (non-isotropic) stochastic perturbations.
  This poses two challenges. Firstly, the system is in general unidentifiable, so
  recent and classical results on parameter recovery do not apply. Secondly, because
  we allow the system to be marginally stable, the state can grow polynomially with
  time; this causes standard regret bounds in online convex optimization to be vacuous.
  In spite of these challenges, we show that the online least-squares algorithm achieves
  sublinear regret (improvable to polylogarithmic in the stochastic setting), with
  polynomial dependence on the systemâ€™s parameters. This requires a refined regret
  analysis, including a structural lemma showing the current state of the system to
  be a small linear combination of past states, even if the state grows polynomially.
  By applying our techniques to learning an autoregressive filter, we also achieve
  logarithmic regret in the partially observed setting under Gaussian noise, with
  polynomial dependence on the memory of the associated Kalman filter."
