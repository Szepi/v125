title: Selfish Robustness and Equilibria in Multi-Player Bandits
abstract: " Motivated by cognitive radios, stochastic multi-player multi-armed bandits
  gained a lot of  interest recently. In this class of problems, several players simultaneously
  pull arms and encounter a collision  – with 0 reward – if some of them pull the
  same arm at the same time. While the cooperative case where players maximize the
  collective reward (obediently following some fixed protocol) has been mostly considered,
  robustness  to malicious players is a crucial  and challenging concern. Existing
  approaches consider only the case of adversarial jammers whose objective is to blindly
  minimize the collective reward. We shall consider instead the more natural class
  of selfish players whose incentives are to maximize their individual rewards, potentially
  at the expense of the social welfare. We provide the first algorithm robust to selfish
  players (a.k.a. Nash equilibrium) with a logarithmic regret, when the arm performance
  is observed.  When collisions are also observed, Grim Trigger type of strategies
  enable some  implicit communication-based algorithms and we construct robust algorithms
  in two different settings: the homogeneous (with a regret comparable to the centralized
  optimal one) and heterogeneous cases (for an adapted and relevant notion of regret).
  We also provide impossibility results when only the reward is observed or when arm
  means vary arbitrarily among players."
