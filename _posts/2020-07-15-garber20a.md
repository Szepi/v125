title: On the Convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent with Low-Rank Projections
  for Convex Low-Rank Matrix Problems
abstract: ' We revisit the use of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for solving convex
  optimization problems that serve as highly popular convex relaxations for many important
  low-rank matrix recovery problems such as matrix completion, phase retrieval, and
  more. The computational limitation of applying SGD to solving these relaxations
  in large-scale is the need to compute a potentially high-rank singular value decomposition
  (SVD) on each iteration in order to enforce the low-rank-promoting constraint. We
  begin by considering a simple and natural sufficient condition so that these relaxations
  indeed admit low-rank solutions. This condition is also necessary for a certain
  notion of low-rank-robustness to hold. Our main result shows that under this condition
  which involves the eigenvalues of the gradient vector at optimal points, SGD with
  mini-batches, when initialized with a â€œwarm-start" point, produces iterates that
  are low-rank with high probability, and hence only a low-rank SVD computation is
  required on each iteration. This suggests that SGD may indeed be practically applicable
  to solving large-scale convex relaxations of low-rank matrix recovery problems.
  Our theoretical results are accompanied with supporting preliminary empirical evidence.
  As a side benefit, our analysis is quite simple and short.'
