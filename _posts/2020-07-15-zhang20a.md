title: Wasserstein Control of Mirror Langevin Monte Carlo
abstract: " Discretized Langevin diffusions are efficient Monte Carlo methods for
  sampling from high dimensional target densities that are log-Lipschitz-smooth and
  (strongly) log-concave. In particular, the Euclidean Langevin Monte Carlo sampling
  algorithm has received much attention lately, leading to a detailed understanding
  of its non-asymptotic convergence properties and of the role that smoothness and
  log-concavity play in the convergence rate. Distributions that do not possess these
  regularity properties can be addressed by considering a Riemannian Langevin diffusion
  with a metric capturing the local geometry of the log-density. However, the Monte
  Carlo algorithms derived from discretizations of such Riemannian Langevin diffusions
  are notoriously difficult to analyze. In this paper, we consider Langevin diffusions
  on a Hessian-type manifold and study a discretization that is closely related to
  the mirror-descent scheme. We establish for the first time a non-asymptotic upper-bound
  on the sampling error of the resulting Hessian Riemannian Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm.
  This bound is measured according to a Wasserstein distance induced by a Riemannian
  metric ground cost capturing the squared Hessian structure and closely related to
  a self-concordance-like condition. The upper-bound implies, for instance, that the
  iterates contract toward a Wasserstein ball around the target density whose radius
  is made explicit. Our theory recovers existing Euclidean results and can cope with
  a wide variety of Hessian metrics related to highly non-flat geometries. "
