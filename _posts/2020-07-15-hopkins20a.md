title: Noise-tolerant, Reliable Active Classification with Comparison Queries
abstract: " With the explosion of massive, widely available unlabeled data in the
  past years, finding label and time efficient, robust learning algorithms has become
  ever more important in theory and in practice. We study the paradigm of active learning,
  in which algorithms with access to large pools of data may adaptively choose what
  samples to label in the hope of exponentially increasing efficiency. By introducing
  comparisons, an additional type of query comparing two points, we provide the first
  time and query efficient algorithms for learning non-homogeneous linear separators
  robust to bounded (Massart) noise. We further provide algorithms for a generalization
  of the popular Tsybakov low noise condition, and show how comparisons provide a
  strong reliability guarantee that is often impractical or impossible with only labels
  - returning a classifier that makes no errors with high probability."
