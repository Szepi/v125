title: Optimal Group Testing
abstract: " In the group testing problem, which goes back to the work of Dorfman (1943),
  we aim to identify a small set of $k\\sim n^\\theta$ infected individuals out of
  a population size $n$, $0<\\theta<1$.We avail ourselves to a test procedure that
  can test a group of individuals, with the test returning a positive result iff at
  least one individual in the group is infected. All tests are conducted in parallel.
  The aim is to devise a test design with as few tests as possible so that the infected
  individuals can be identified with high probability. We establish an explicit sharp
  information-theoretic/algorithmic phase transition $m_{inf}$, showing that with
  more than $\\minf$ tests the infected individuals can be identified in polynomial
  time, while this is impossible with fewer tests. In addition, we obtain an optimal
  two-stage adaptive group testing scheme. These results resolve problems prominently
  posed in [Aldridge et al. 2019, Johnson et al. 2018, MÃ©zard and Toninelli 2011]."
