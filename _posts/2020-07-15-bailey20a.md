title: Finite Regret and Cycles with Fixed Step-Size via Alternating Gradient Descent-Ascent
abstract: " Gradient descent is arguably one of the most popular online optimization
  methods with a wide array of applications.  However, the standard implementation
  where agents simultaneously update their strategies yields several undesirable properties;
  strategies diverge  away from equilibrium and regret grows over time. In this paper,
  we eliminate these negative properties by considering a different implementation
  to obtain $O\\left( \\nicefrac{1}{T}\\right)$ time-average regret via arbitrary
  fixed step-size. We obtain this surprising property by having agents take turns
  when updating their strategies. In this setting, we show that an agent  that uses
  gradient descent with any linear loss function obtains bounded regret – regardless
  of how their opponent updates their strategies.  Furthermore, we show that in adversarial
  settings that agents’ strategies are bounded and cycle when both are using the alternating
  gradient descent algorithm."
