title: On Suboptimality of Least Squares with Application to Estimation of Convex
  Bodies
abstract: " We develop a technique for establishing lower bounds on the sample complexity
  of Least Squares (or, Empirical Risk Minimization) for large classes of functions.
  As an application, we settle an open problem regarding optimality of Least Squares
  in estimating a convex set from noisy support function measurements in dimension
  $d\\geq 6$. Specifically, we establish that Least Squares is mimimax sub-optimal,
  and achieves a rate of $\\tilde{\\Theta}_d(n^{-2/(d-1)})$ whereas the minimax rate
  is $\\Theta_d(n^{-4/(d+3)})$."
