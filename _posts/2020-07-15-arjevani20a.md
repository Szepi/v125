title: 'Second-Order Information in Non-Convex Stochastic Optimization: Power and
  Limitations'
abstract: " We design an algorithm which finds an $\\epsilon$-approximate stationary
  point (with $\\|\\nabla F(x)\\|\\le \\epsilon$) using $O(\\epsilon^{-3})$ stochastic
  gradient and Hessian-vector products, matching guarantees that were previously available
  only under a stronger assumption of access to multiple queries with the same random
  seed. We prove a lower bound which establishes that this rate is optimal and—surprisingly—that
  it cannot be improved using stochastic $p$th order methods for any $p\\ge 2$, even
  when the first $p$ derivatives of the objective are Lipschitz. Together, these results
  characterize the complexity of non-convex stochastic optimization with second-order
  methods and beyond. Expanding our scope to the oracle complexity of finding $(\\epsilon,\\gamma)$-approximate
  second-order stationary points, we establish nearly matching upper and lower bounds
  for stochastic second-order methods. Our lower bounds here are novel even in the
  noiseless case."
