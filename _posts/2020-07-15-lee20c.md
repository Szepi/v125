title: An $\widetilde\mathcal{O}(m/\varepsilon^3.5)$-Cost Algorithm for Semidefinite
  Programs with Diagonal Constraints
abstract: "We provide a first-order algorithm for semidefinite programs (SDPs) with
  diagonal constraints on the matrix variable. Our algorithm outputs an $\\varepsilon$-optimal
  solution with a run time of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(m/\\varepsilon^{3.5})$, where
  $m$ is the number of non-zero entries in the cost matrix. This improves upon the
  previous best run time of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(m/\\varepsilon^{4.5})$ by Arora
  and Kale. As a corollary of our result, given an instance of the Max-Cut problem
  with $n$ vertices and $m \\gg n$ edges, our algorithm returns a $(1 - \\varepsilon)\\alpha_{GW}$
  cut in the faster time of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(m/\\varepsilon^{3.5})$, where
  $\\alpha_{GW} \\approx 0.878567$ is the approximation ratio by Goemans and Williamson.
  Our key technical contribution is to combine an approximate variant of the Arora-Kale
  framework of mirror descent for SDPs with the idea of trading off exact computations
  in every iteration for variance-reduced estimations in most iterations, only periodically
  resetting the accumulated error with exact computations. This idea, along with the
  constructed estimator, are of possible independent interest for other problems that
  use the mirror descent framework. "
