title: Hardness of Identity Testing for Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Potts models
abstract: " We study identity testing for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), and
  more generally for undirected graphical models. Given sample access to the Gibbs
  distribution corresponding to an unknown or hidden model $M^*$  and given an explicit
  model $M$, can we distinguish if either $M = M^*$ or if they are (statistically)
  far apart? Daskalakis et al. (2018) presented a polynomial-time algorithm for identity
  testing for the ferromagnetic (attractive) Ising model. In contrast, for the antiferromagnetic
  (repulsive) Ising model, Bezáková et al. (2019) proved that unless $RP=NP$ there
  is no identity testing algorithm when $\\beta d=\\omega(\\log{n})$, where $d$ is
  the maximum degree of the visible graph and $\\beta$ is the largest edge weight
  (in absolute value). We prove analogous hardness results for RBMs (i.e., mixed Ising
  models on bipartite graphs), even when there are no latent variables or an external
  field. Specifically, we show that if $RP\\neq NP$, then when $\\beta d=\\omega(\\log{n})$
  there is no polynomial-time algorithm for identity testing for RBMs; when $\\beta
  d =O(\\log{n})$ there is an efficient identity testing algorithm that utilizes the
  structure learning algorithm of Klivans and Meka (2017). In addition, we prove similar
  lower bounds for purely ferromagnetic RBMs with inconsistent external fields, and
  for the ferromagnetic Potts model. Previous hardness results for identity testing
  of Bezáková et al. (2019) utilized the hardness of finding the maximum cuts, which
  corresponds to the ground states of the antiferromagnetic Ising model. Since RBMs
  are on bipartite graphs such an approach is not feasible. We instead introduce a
  novel methodology to reduce from the corresponding approximate counting problem
  and utilize the phase transition that is exhibited by RBMs and the mean-field Potts
  model. We believe that our method is general, and that it can be used to establish
  the hardness of identity testing for other spin systems."
